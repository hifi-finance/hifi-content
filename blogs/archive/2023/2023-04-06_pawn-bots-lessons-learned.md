Pawn Bots: Lessons Learned

Our [previous blog](https://blog.hifi.finance/pawn-bots-end-of-life-next-steps-d2be9766cb09) post announced our plans to move away from Pawn Bots towards a new NFT collection. This post reflects back on what we accomplished with Pawn Bots and the major lessons we learned along the way.

### What we planned for

Our initial goal was to create a collection that did the following:
1. Educate our team and audience about the NFT space.
2. Be a safe collection to use in new experiments that we re-issue if something were to go massively wrong.
3. Use royalties from marketplaces to feed liquidity of the collection.
4. Engage with collectors beyond the initial mint.

We did accomplish many of these objectives and more. For instance, we’re proud of the fact that what started as a free mint grew to sustain a healthy $170 floor price. We felt the quality of the artwork exceeded collectors’ expectations and the collection quality represented our community well. And most importantly, Pawn Bots did an excellent job helping us pilot Pooled NFT v1. Highlighting what Pawn Bots accomplished serves to remind us that this experiment wasn’t a failure.

### Lessons Learned

First, NFT projects cannot count on royalties for substantial revenue generation. We had hoped to take the fees earned from royalties and source liquidity for the collection. The entire space experienced a foundational shift that still hasn’t entirely played out yet. Today you cannot count on royalties as a significant source of revenue for any purpose.

Second, invest upfront in any workflow automation. Once your collection is live, expectations of collectors change. I wish we had taken the time to automate our rendering workflows such that turnaround times between phases could be as close to real-time renderings as possible. This makes the whole process more engaging and rewarding for collectors and reduces the trust needed in the team to participate and learn about the dynamic nature of Pawn Bots.

Third, recognize that your position on major marketplaces may be decided by regular employees at those marketplaces. The way this would have impacted us is that I would have deprioritized Pawn Bots’ nostalgic tech theme. Our initial hope was to resonate with collectors through Pawn Bot’s artwork. We had early conversations discussing potential risks; we did adjust some of our designs and kept everything that, in our judgment, fell well within the terms of fair use. We did not anticipate that the judgment call on what constitutes fair use most likely is being managed by customer service reps at OpenSea, rather than their legal department. So lesson learned, play it safe and try to avoid this scenario altogether.

### The Big Tradeoff

Lastly, as I reflect on everything, there is one specific decision we made with Pawn Bots that I believe contributed the most to hurting growth — the decision to make Pawn Bots a dynamic collection through the meltdown and forge phases. From the beginning, we wanted to build an NFT that could set us apart from others. We noted that for many collections, there was a pattern of massive engagement leading up to the mint and initial reveal, followed by an almost immediate loss of interest and a slow bleed-off of community engagement. We reasoned that if we could introduce new traits and the ability to customize our NFTs, collectors would have a reason to stay, and we’d build a more active and engaged community. Who doesn’t want that? We certainly do!

On the surface, it sounds like a great idea, with the best of intentions. But in reality, it introduced complexity, increased the cost of participation, and made the collection undesirable for passive collectors. The added complexity hurt us on multiple fronts.

The amount of effort to take a new user with zero knowledge to the point at which they understood what Pawn Bots is, grew exponentially. As time went on, our team struggled to keep the website updated. There wasn’t a single resource we could point to that brought new collectors up to speed. To be in the know, you had to keep up on Medium, Discord, and Twitter, then dedicate time to actually participating once you caught up.

Important aspects of the collection were constantly in motion. So instead of helping us build a more active and engaged community, we unintentionally created a silent natural filter on the community that basically limited us to a very narrow subset of people who have and were willing to dedicate significant portions of time to Pawn Bots. In hindsight, it’s not surprising that most people just don’t have that much time to give to an NFT collection.

For passive collectors, with each passing forge, their NFTs fell in rarity. They simply were not playing the same game as the active collectors. The constant changes made learning the collection traits difficult and, I believe, ultimately reduced the amount of trading that otherwise would have happened.

### Conclusion

So now, as we look to building our next collection, we have the benefits of learning from our own first-hand experiences and a chance to reflect and study the key principles and common themes we see with other successful projects. In my next blog post, I’ll share what I’m seeing and give insight into the ideas shaping my thinking going forward. I’ll also share the principles I believe we should use to guide our decision-making and help steer our community.

Finally, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to our amazing community. Thank you for being a part of this journey and learning alongside our team! We’re excited for the next chapter and what we build together.
