One More Thing…

Earlier this week, we introduced you to Hifi’s [first real-world asset](https://blog.hifi.finance/introducing-our-first-real-world-asset-2395668f5aaf). Today we want to introduce you to the owner of that VW microbus, explain why we want to work with them and highlight the massive opportunity that stands before us.

### Kevin Bradburn

Kevin is the CEO of Orchard Securities, a broker-dealer and investment banking service provider for security offerings. Through his professional network and role at Orchard Securities, Kevin has access to over **$100M** in demand for real-world asset-backed debt across a broad spectrum of asset classes. This is why it is a good idea to show him first-hand how tokenization of Real-World Assets and borrowing with Hifi works. We like Kevin and are excited to build a relationship with him and Orchard.

### Massive Opportunity

In a lending protocol like Hifi, there are two sides to its internal debt market, the demand side and the supply side. With Kevin, we gain access to $100,000,000 of demand! Along with this demand, we now have a $100,000,000 supply-side problem, a massive opportunity for Hifi.

We don’t have all the answers now, but we will need to look for innovative solutions and work together as a community to take our protocol to over **$100M** in TVL. Half the work is done, and it’s time to focus on how to bootstrap supply for Hifi. We won’t meet demand overnight, but we will be working to meet as much as possible.

We invite you to stay connected with us. Keep an eye on our announcements, participate in our discussions, and be a part of the growing community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uGxaCppKSH) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hififinance).
