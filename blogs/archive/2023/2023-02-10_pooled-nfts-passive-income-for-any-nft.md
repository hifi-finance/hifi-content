Pooled NFTs: Passive Income For Any NFT

Pooling NFTs is a way to turn any NFT collection into passive income. The concept is simple, users deposit NFTs into Pools and receive a normal ERC-20 token for each NFT they deposit. Since ERC-20 is the token standard most used across Ethereum and decentralized finance, users can then take these Pool Tokens into the many applications that support ERC-20 tokens!

With access to new frontiers in DeFi, there will be many new ways for collectors to earn using their NFTs. Let’s highlight one of the most powerful ways collectors can earn passive income that works for any collection.

### Passive Income For Any NFT

Adding liquidity to Uniswap is one of the easiest ways to passively buy low and sell high. Liquidity providers automatically earn income from Uniswap trading fees. Pairing Pool Tokens with ETH or USDC in Uniswap is an easy and powerful way to earn passive income for any NFT Collection. If you’re not sure how to do this, don’t worry, there are plenty of tutorials you can google and we will cover it in detail for you, in a future blog post!

Pooling NFTs is a simple concept with many powerful implications. Pooled NFTs not only bridge any NFT collections into decentralized finance (DeFi), but they also unlock fractional ownership for any NFT Collection. This is huge because it enables a much larger audience to gain exposure to collections that otherwise are priced out of the market. That’s a big win for project growth!

Is there a catch? We don't think so. Our smart contracts are open source. There are no fees or unnecessary admin permissions. Every Pool Token is backed one-to-one with an NFT from its respective collection. We see this as a necessary and much-needed public good that should exist in the space.

### When can I use it?

While we are still in the early stages of building this tool out, we have deployed the smart contracts live on Ethereum Mainnet! Check out [**PooledNFT.com](https://poolednft.com/#/welcome)* ***if you’re an early adopter. We’ve prepared a very crude interface that focuses on pure functionality, just for you. In time expect this to become much more refined, as we gather feedback from our users.

Out of the gate, we support ERC-721 and plan to ship support for ERC-1155 shortly.

### How it works

Each NFT collection gets its very own NFT Pool. Similar to Uniswap markets, anyone can deploy a pool for any collection. This only has to be done once and our smart contracts prevent duplicate pools from being deployed.

NFTs are pooled together into a collection-specific pool that effectively makes each deposited NFT interchangeable with any other NFT from the same collection. Meaning, if you see an NFT in the pool that you like and want to swap it for one you already have, you can! We don't charge any fees and all you have to do is pay the gas to validators.

The smart contracts ensure that Pool NFTs are always fully backed by an NFT from its respective collection. But, because NFTs from the same collection can be freely traded in and out of their pool, you are not guaranteed that any **particular** NFT from a collection will be in the pool, just that there will be one from that collection. It is reasonable to assume that the most desired NFTs will be traded out from the pool regularly.

### Stay Safe

These smart contracts are relatively simple, our team has reviewed them thoroughly for possible bugs, and written extensive tests. However, Pooled NFTs have ***not*** been audited and risks always exist with new software. Given that most things on a blockchain are irreversible we’ve prepared an NFT collection that we control to help mitigate some of these early risks.

Our own NFT collection, [Pawn Bots](https://opensea.io/collection/pawnbots), is the first collection to make use of Pooled NFTs. If something were to go drastically wrong, we can reissue Pawn Bots with ease. We will seed liquidity on Uniswap with both USDC and ETH pairs. *So look out for new arbitrage opportunities between the Uniswap pools and other NFT marketplaces like Open Sea.*

That’s it, for now. Welcome to the new era for NFT collectors where liquidity, fractionalization, and DeFi are all within reach for any NFT collection! Happy experimenting!
