HIP 5 Revote Live

As many of you may know, the vote for Hifi Improvement Proposal 5 went out last week and failed to meet the quorum, the minimum number of votes needed for a proposal to pass. With the quorum set at 2,403,398 HIFI (2% of total HIFI supply), the initial attempt on HIP 5 failed to meet the quorum by 812,206 HIFI.

## Revote

Given the fact that all votes cast were in favor of the HIP 5 proposal, it seemed appropriate to put HIP 5 up for a second vote. After allowing the community time to regroup and ensure they have their HIFI token balances off of exchanges and in a self-custody wallet, HIP 5 Revote is live on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/4?chart=0). To view proposal details and to cast your votes, simply head over to the proposal on [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/4?chart=0)!

## Vote Timeline

Get involved and go vote! The vote window will be open for 5 days. If the voting threshold is met and the proposal passes, the process to implement the changes will begin. If the vote does not pass, no changes will be made and it may not be prudent to proceed with this proposal.

Let’s work together to get this passed! We’d love to hear your thoughts on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uGxaCppKSH) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hififinance).
