Minting Sheet Heads

Go mint your Sheet Heads! The official mint page for Sheet Heads is [sheetheads.com](https://sheetheads.com/). The only way to mint a Sheet Head is to burn a [Pawn Bot](https://blur.io/collection/pawnbots) from our previous collection (previously burned Pawn Bots count too). Pawn Bots holders will have to decide whether they want to hold their Bots or burn them for a Sheet Head of **matching rarity. **The max number of Sheet Heads to be minted is 8,888. Minting will have a deadline that we’ll announce in the future.

### Previously Burned Bots

For those that participated in burning Pawn Bots previously, you're in luck. Connect to the mint page using the same wallet used to burn and you will be able to mint one Sheet Head for each previously burned bot.

**Note: **when minting Sheet Heads it should be noted that all Pawn Bots in your wallet will be burned to mint Sheet Heads. If you have any Pawn Bots you wish to keep move them to a different wallet before minting.

### **Rarity Mapping**

When it comes to determining the rarity of your Sheet Heads the process is pretty straightforward. Each Sheet Head minted will have the same rarity as the Pawn Bot used to mint it. So if you burn a Pawn Bot ranked #1500 in rarity you will receive a Sheet Head ranked #1500 in rarity. It should be noted that the Pawn Bots' rarity was determined by a snapshot from Rarity Sniper. However, moving forward Sheet Heads will be using Open Rarity for ranking.

### Minting Horsey Men and 1:1s

As we previously outlined there are tiers of rarity in the collections, Horsey Men and 1:1s. The rarest tier is the 1:1s. There are only 16 of these in the collection, and each one is completely unique. In order to mint one** you must** burn a 1:1 Pawn Bot. 1:1 Sheet Head holders will have the opportunity to generate a collection based on their 1:1 with the support of our team!

There are 327 Horsey Men in the collection. They can be minted by burning Pawn Bots ranked from #17 to #343. Holders of these NFTs will receive future [Crown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/) related perks.
