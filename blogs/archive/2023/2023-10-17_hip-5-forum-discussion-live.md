HIP 5 Forum Discussion Live

The forum discussion for the fifth Hifi Improvement Proposal is now live! This proposal aims to add Sheet Heads as Collateral to the Hifi Lending Protocol. Now is your opportunity to review the proposal and discuss it with other DAO members before voting goes live on Tally.xyz. Join the forum discussion [here](https://forum.hifi.finance/t/hip-5-sheet-heads-collateral/297).

### Giveaway Winners

If you read our [previous blog](https://blog.hifi.finance/sheet-heads-nfts-as-collateral-9ee7c6e4b1c5), you knew the upcoming proposal would include a healthy time-weighted average price feed (TWAP) feeding the price oracle. To feed the TWAP additional data, we hosted a daily giveaway of $SHEETp for anyone who bought and sold $SHEETp on Uniswap. Congratulations to the daily raffle winners!

### Next Steps

The official proposal is expected to go live next week. In order to participate in HIFI DAO governance, ensure your HIFI tokens are in a self-custody wallet like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/registry/wallets) **before** the proposal goes live. Remember, after the passing of [HIP 4](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/2), the voting period for each proposal has been extended from 2 days to 5 days.

Weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and opinions on the latest proposal. Our team is active on both [Twitter](https://twitter.com/poolednft) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/B3T9zPJXMf). See you there!
