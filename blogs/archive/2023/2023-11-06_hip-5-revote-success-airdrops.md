HIP 5 Revote Success + Airdrops!

After a 5-day voting period, the [HIP 5 revote](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/4?chart=0) passed unanimously! With that, the proposal will be queued for execution utilizing a [Timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xac46db50b44bbef8dc25f778359e1834248147f7#readContract) delay set at 2 days before the DAO can execute the code. During this time, Hifi Labs will update the lending protocol’s front-end and liquidation bot to support $SHEETp as collateral.

Congratulations to the Hifi DAO! This significant milestone grants holders of [Sheet Heads NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/sheet-heads) the ability to borrow against their NFTs using the Hifi Protocol’s DeFi infrastructure, providing the collection with additional liquidity for collectors.

## Airdrops

What better way to celebrate a successful proposal than some airdrops? This massive airdrop includes several rewards and reimbursements to participants to commemorate those who have shown up and taken action. This snapshot includes all Tally transactions from the Hifi DAO, including HIP 3, HIP 4, HIP 5, and the HIP 5 Revote!

* **Proposal Contributor Reimbursements:** To everyone who took the initiative by submitting, queueing, or executing any proposals, we are reimbursing the gas costs incurred during these transactions.

* **Voter Reimbursements:** To everyone who cast votes on any Hifi DAO proposals, we’re reimbursing you the gas costs for those transactions.

## Special Recognition

And finally, to thank our dedicated guardian [@Hollywood41x](https://twitter.com/Hollywood41x), we’re sending him $1K in $HIFI tokens! During the last month, @Hollywood41x made dozens of Tweets and exponentially more Discord messages urging others to vote and delegate, even reaching out to HIFI Token holders individually. With your positive vibes and constant willingness to help others, the Hifi DAO is lucky to have you as a guardian. We truly believe your efforts helped make the collateralization of Sheet Heads a reality!

Congratulations again to everyone! The airdrops will be sent out within the week. We invite you to come and celebrate our efforts with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uGxaCppKSH) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hififinance).
