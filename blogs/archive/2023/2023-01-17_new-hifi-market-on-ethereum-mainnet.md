New Hifi Market on Ethereum Mainnet

Today, we are thrilled to announce that the [Hifi Lending Protocol](https://app.hifi.finance/) is now live on the Ethereum Mainnet. This marks a significant milestone for our team, and we are excited to bring this platform to the world.

### Supported Collateral

The Hifi Lending Protocol maintains the same Lend, Borrow, and Pool options as previous iterations, now on the Ethereum blockchain. Our first supported collateral on the platform is ETH and we have plans to bring other types of collateral to the platform in the future.
