Get Involved: HIP 5 Voting Is Live

Hifi Improvement Proposal 5 is live on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/3?chart=0), and aims to integrate the “SHEETp” token into the Hifi Protocol as collateral. To cast your votes, simply head over to the proposal on [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/3?chart=0)! Before voting, feel free to view or join the community discussion on the [Hifi Forum](https://forum.hifi.finance/t/hip-5-sheet-heads-collateral/297/3).

### Vote Timeline

The vote window will be open for 5 days. If the voting threshold is met and the proposal passes, the process to implement the changes will begin. If the vote does not pass, no changes will be made and future drafts of the proposal may be considered if necessary.
