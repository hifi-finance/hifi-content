# Sheet Heads NFTs as Collateral

Sheet Heads NFTs as Collateral

Just under a year ago, we published [Our Customer](https://blog.hifi.finance/our-customer-d1f956a87e90) — a blog post that clearly established NFT Communities as the customer Hifi is targeting. The blog discussed the role NFTs were playing in onboarding new users to blockchain and took note of what the future of NFTs would look like.
> Today, most NFTs represent digital collectibles. Looking ahead into the future, we can see NFTs being used to tokenize ownership of Real World Assets (RWAs) including art, real estate, and other luxury goods.

We were right, and already, our team has done the hard work of tokenizing [our first Real World Asset](https://blog.hifi.finance/introducing-our-first-real-world-asset-2395668f5aaf) as an NFT and added it as collateral to the Hifi Lending Protocol. But much has changed in the past 11 months, specifically for NFTs representing digital collectibles; these collections have seen a broad pullback in the market. Small and large collections have been impacted, including our very own Sheet Heads NFT.

### Value Proposition

Given this context, let’s understand the value of adding Sheet Heads as Collateral on Hifi. The main value proposition in doing this will be a demonstration of protocol capabilities and limitations that will apply to future collateral types. Additional value comes from seeing our experiment through to the end, asserting that we are able to mitigate the risks of bad debt properly. And finally, it’s worth observing the impact collateralizing digital collectibles may have on a collection.

### Acknowledging Reality

It’s worth being explicit about the following. Sheet Heads is a digital collectible that can be highly volatile. Sheet Heads has relatively low liquidity. If another NFT project approached us with a similar risk profile, it is extremely unlikely we would add that collection as collateral. Sheet Heads could be a source of bad debt on our protocol. None of these things are good things, but they are the truth, and it’s not worth hiding from this reality when real money is at stake.

### Mitigating Risk

Remember that HIFI token holders are ultimately responsible for deciding what gets added to the protocol as collateral and ensuring that proper risk parameters are in place to help prevent the protocol from accruing bad debt. Here’s what you can expect in the upcoming proposal.

The proposal will include six specific elements aimed at mitigating the risk of bad debt — first, durable liquidity provided by the core team. Second, the core team has prepared a custom price feed with an admin-managed price ceiling for an extra layer of safety. Third, a conservative collateral ceiling puts an upper bound on how much collateral can be deposited into the protocol. Fourth, a generous liquidation incentive for liquidators. Fifth, a healthy time-weighted average price feed (TWAP) feeding the price oracle. Finally, a conservative collateralization ratio, also known as a Loan to Value (LTV) ratio.

### Next Steps

With these elements in place, we believe that we can reasonably mitigate the risks of bad debt for the Hifi protocol. But it is up to HIFI token holders to decide. Remember token holders can only vote with tokens in a self-custody wallet, be sure to move tokens off of exchanges as needed. Soon, we will publish this proposal on the [Hifi Forum](https://forum.hifi.finance/) that will detail the specific parameter values and allow for a broader conversation with the community before putting this up for a vote by HIFI token holders.
