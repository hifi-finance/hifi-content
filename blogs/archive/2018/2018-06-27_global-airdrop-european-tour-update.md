# Global Airdrop & European Tour Update



Team, we’ll keep this one short. Just a couple things we need to communicate.

By now, many of you have seen news of Mainframe hosting a “*Global Airdrop”*. People have asked us if this is *really* from Mainframe, or if it’s a scam.

Consider this the official announcement:

Mainframe*** is in fact*** hosting a Global Airdrop! 
[See the banner at the top of our *Tokens* page](https://mainframe.com/tokens/).

Unlike our physical Airdrop events, the Global Airdrop is similar to those you’ve already seen in the crypto space. We love the members of our community that are so dedicated (and nearby) to attend the physical Airdrops (more on that in a bit). But we know not everyone can attend. Call it an extension of our [Phase 1 Crowdgift, *“Proof of Being”](https://blog.mainframe.com/crowdgift-phase-1-proof-of-being-3591a7f52475)*. All of us are on the global Internet together, and the Mainframe mission for privacy and freedom touches everyone. We want to give the world *one last chance* to get MFT before token distribution in just *one week!*

It’s hard to say how much MFT we’ll distribute in the Global Airdrop, since multiple variables need to be determined first, like how many people register.

Second item of business: Our European Airdrop tour is coming to a close, and it’s been *amazing! *We made a quick video to show how it’s been.

Our Amsterdam event starts in just a couple hours (Austin is typing this out *furiously* from the event floor). We’re looking forward to finishing this European journey with one of the best events yet. We hope to see you there, and for everyone else, [we hope you’ll be part of our Global Airdrop](https://mainframe.com/tokens/)!
