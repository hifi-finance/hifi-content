# Meet Team Mainframe

This is only part of the team, and we’re growing all the time. It’s a fun crowd.

We’d really like to introduce you to each member of the Mainframe team personally. Each person is here for a reason, and has a story to tell. And hopefully we’ll get the chance to tell all of those stories individually.

Until then, we hope you like this team video. It’s quick, and there’s a lot to cover. But you’ll get a feel for who is here on the core team, and why we’re so excited to be working together.

The mission we’ve undertake at Mainframe isn’t a little thing. This is a huge task; building the new web, where privacy, security, and freedom are built in from the ground up. But it’s important, and everybody here is up for the challenge.

Want to join us? Think you’ve got what it takes to move the mission forward?

[We’re hiring, and we want to hear from you](https://mainframe.com/jobs/). And hey, if you don’t see a position that matches your incredible skills and abilities, that’s okay. Make the introduction anyway. We’re always eager to hear from the best, and find creative ways to make the Mainframe dream a reality.
