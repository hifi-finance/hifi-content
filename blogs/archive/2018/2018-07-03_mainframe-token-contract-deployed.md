Mainframe Token Contract Deployed

***UPDATE**: Please see our new blog post for all Mainframe Token Contract information: [https://blog.mainframe.com/important-mft-contract-redeployed-4f0b0bd8dc3b](https://blog.mainframe.com/important-mft-contract-redeployed-4f0b0bd8dc3b)*

We are thrilled to announce that the official MFT token contract has been deployed.

Contract Address: *<removed legacy address>
*Symbol: MFT
Decimals: 18

Be careful of scamming and phishing schemes out there and always verify that any purported source of tokens is legitimate. You can do this by viewing whatâ€™s on our [Mainframe ENS](https://etherscan.io/address/token.mainframehq.eth).

The distribution of tokens (locked) to contributors and airdrop participants is now underway, proceeding as quickly as network congestion permits. The tokens will be locked until July 4th (specific time to be announced soon).

This is an important milestone in the history of the Internet, a move towards greater privacy and freedom. Stay tuned as we build the next web, with your help.
