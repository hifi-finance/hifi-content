Pre-Sale Partners: Builders in the Ecosystem

### This is the final part of our [four-part series](https://blog.mainframe.com/introducing-the-mainframe-pre-sale-partners-4b0b0bf74ac) highlighting some of our pre-sale partners. Read [Part 1](https://blog.mainframe.com/pre-sale-partners-media-personalities-f23e7549d932) or [Part 2/3](https://blog.mainframe.com/pre-sale-partners-funds-angels-729a48571f10).

This is the final announcement related to our pre-sale partners. To me, this is the most important one. These are the people who are in the arena, laying the groundwork for the new decentralized web. These are the doers, makers and builders. These are the people who I most respect, and so far have been the most valuable and helpful.

I’m really humbled (yet proud) that so many in our ecosystem have chosen to support Mainframe. It’s clear that our technology needs to exist, and that it’ll benefit so many other projects out there. The entire ecosystem is embracing our project, our vision and our values. From funds to founders, we’re backed by some of the most respected in the space.

Below are a few of the builders/founders who participated in our pre-sale:

**Gavin Wood ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)/[Parity](https://www.parity.io/))** — Co-founded and former CTO of Ethereum, founder of Parity, Web3 Foundation, and Polkadot. Parity is the backbone for fast and secure building on the Ethereum network. Though the Mainframe network will allow developers to build applications anywhere, we’ve chosen Ethereum for its reliability, high performance, and robust dev community.
