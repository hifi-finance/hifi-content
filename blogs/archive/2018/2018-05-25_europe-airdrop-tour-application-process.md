Europe Airdrop Tour — Application Process

*TLDR: Given how much demand there is to attend one of our official Airdrop events, there will now be [an application process](https://mainframenetwork.typeform.com/to/ZaPxBS) to attend.*

Last week we announced [our next 6 cities](https://blog.mainframe.com/mainframe-europe-airdrop-tour-cities-announced-5bf0b0ab30f7) for our [literal, physical Airdrops](https://blog.mainframe.com/crowdgift-phase-1-proof-of-being-3591a7f52475). We’re coming to Europe! We couldn’t be more stoked to meet our community there.

So far we’ve done six Airdrop events. In each city we’ve developed new friendships, heard incredible stories about your passion for freedom and privacy, and have felt the power & strength of this community. Just as our technology is unstoppable, so is our community.

With each Airdrop event comes new ideas and new improvements. Given how much demand there has been to attend our past events, we’re incorporating a new process to try and make sure we can accommodate the **right** people at each event.

We are changing our ticketing process. **Moving forward, we will use a mandatory application process for everyone who wants to attend one of our Airdrop events. **The application will be short and simple — it will ask for some basic information about yourself, why you’re excited about Mainframe, and how you want to be involved in our community.

This application process will allow more people to attend each event as we’ll be able to measure demand and book venues accordingly. This means more MFT in your pockets! It will also mean those who are most passionate and excited about Mainframe and our mission should have no problem getting a ticket for the event (if their application shines).

And don’t worry, even if you aren’t selected to attend an official Airdrop, we will be hosting frequent “pop-up” Airdrops throughout our tour. You’ll still be able to meet our team, get involved in our community, and snag some Mainframe gear (and some MFT)

➡️ [Start your application here.](https://mainframenetwork.typeform.com/to/ZaPxBS) It should only take a minute or two. We can’t wait to come to Europe!
