## How to stake your own MFT in Onyx

NOTE: For anybody interested in discussing Onyx with the community, we now have a Telegram channel just for testing. [***Click through here](https://t.me/mainframetesting)*** to join.

Mainframe fans throughout the world are chomping at the bit to try our platform. Did you participate in the global airdrop or one of our recent physical airdrops? Wondering what to do with that shiny new MFT? Look no further! The following guide shows how easy it is to use Mainframe tokens to participate on the Mainframe network.

First, you’ll need to download the latest version of Onyx from [our releases page](https://github.com/MainframeHQ/onyx/releases). After installing the app, it will guide you through the process of staking your MFT. We’ve made a how-to video to make it easy for you.

Bear in mind that this is an alpha prototype demonstrating some of the functionality in the Mainframe platform, including censorship and surveillance resistance through dark routing. It is not a polished product and has several [known limitations](https://github.com/MainframeHQ/onyx#known-issues). Much can and will change as the platform evolves. We’d love to hear your feedback. Feel free to reach out to us [on telegram](https://t.me/mainframetesting).
