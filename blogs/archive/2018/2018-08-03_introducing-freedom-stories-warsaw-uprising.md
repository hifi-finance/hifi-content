It might be that anyone who studies history should feel a slight twinge of survivor’s guilt. The past is littered with horror, and so much of it is the product of *some* people concertedly destroying the liberty, and ultimately the lives, of other people.

While in Europe on our Airdrop tour, we wanted to remember the real reason we’re building Mainframe. The technology is cool, and airdrop parties are fun. But there is more to this movement. The Internet is such a pervasive force in modern life, that your online is life is often indistinguishable from our offline life. It’s just *your life*. And you should have the means to choose control in your own life.

We’re building tools to grant normal people power over their own lives. And there are instructive lessons from the past on what it looks like when people are denied that power.

We took time to visit historic locations that represent past struggles for freedom and independence. There was no shortage of significant landmarks, only a shortage of time.

This video is the first in a series highlighting those locations, and more importantly, the people behind them. If we don’t learn and remember the lessons of history, we risk enacting those same horrors again.
