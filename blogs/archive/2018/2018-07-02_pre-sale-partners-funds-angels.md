Pre-Sale Partners: Funds & Angels

### This is part 2 and 3 of our [four-part series](https://blog.mainframe.com/introducing-the-mainframe-pre-sale-partners-4b0b0bf74ac) highlighting some of our pre-sale partners. Read [Part 1](https://blog.mainframe.com/pre-sale-partners-media-personalities-f23e7549d932).

We’ve partnered with some amazing funds and angels. The full list is simply just too long to share but we’ve highlighted a few of them here. This lineup of strategic partners includes traditional VC powers like [Michael Arrington](http://arringtonxrpcapital.com/), alongside a Who’s Who of the biggest players in crypto: [BlockTower](https://blocktower.com/), [FBG](https://www.fbg.capital/), [NEO Global](http://ngc.fund/), [Kenetic](https://kenetic.capital/), [Danhua](http://danhuacap.com/), [GBIC](https://gbic.io/), and many more.

## Funds

All got small fractions of what they wanted. But we refused to let any one entity, no matter who they were, to be able to assert any sort of control. Below are a few of the more prominent funds involved.
