There’s never a dull day at Mainframe. We’re always finding ways to push the work forward, faster. Here’s the udpate:

This week the Mainframe Token (MFT) was listed on two more exchanges; [Bittrex](https://twitter.com/BittrexExchange/status/1017474824309035009) and [Upbit](https://twitter.com/Mainframe_HQ/status/1017824904345841664).

We know not everybody could make it to our European Airdrop events, but we hope [this new video](https://youtu.be/H7hqZlAs9mg) will give you a glimpse into the experience.

For even more, [see out full write-up here on the blog](https://blog.mainframe.com/the-european-airdrop-tour-927e321f6457).

We’re now ready to wrap up the global airdrop. We’ve processed fallout from rampant scammers, bugs in Telegram, user error, and congestion on the Ethereum network.

Community members who previously registered for the global airdrop have until 11:59:59 PM Mountain Daylight Time on Friday, July 20th before we close redemption *forever*.

Coming into Frame…

We’ll soon release a full video intro and tutorial on how to download, install, and start using [Onyx](https://github.com/MainframeHQ/onyx). We’ll explain all the features and demonstrate staking your MFT. If you’re ready to download and get started right away, you can check out Onyx from [our Github repository](https://github.com/MainframeHQ/onyx).

Also on the horizon is a more detailed roadmap. Stay tuned, and we’ll share exactly where we’re headed, along with how and when we’ll get there.
