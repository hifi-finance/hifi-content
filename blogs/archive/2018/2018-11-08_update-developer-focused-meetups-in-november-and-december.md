Update: Developer-focused Meetups in November and December

In my second month at Mainframe, there are two things that are reinforced time and time again:

1. The Mainframe team is mission-driven, incredibly talented, and really have developers and users top-of-mind.

1. There are so many talented and supportive Mainframe community members.

As an organization, we‚Äôre incredibly lucky for #2; as a Mainframe team member, I‚Äôm very grateful for #1.

Just as [October was super busy](https://blog.mainframe.com/kickstarting-developer-meetups-and-other-events-f268c7ce41d6) for us, November and December 2018 will be equally busy. Before I run through the events we have planned (as of today) for the next two months, I want to highlight a few notable items:

1. We had an amazing week at DevCon last week where we were a scholarship and grant sponsor. It was a week of learning and meeting new friends and potential partners. We also hosted the inaugural [Dapp Awards](https://blog.mainframe.com/the-dapp-awards-highlights-recap-45d29747d15c), where we celebrated all the #buidlers helping to grow the dapp ecosystem. I‚Äôm so proud of our team. They executed flawlessly and we worked as a team. It was an incredibly busy week at DevCon and am excited for all the good things that will come from it.

1. We premiered our [Dawn of the Dapps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVZxjVJz4ds) video, which metaphorically portrays the current state of the dapp ecosystem as a lemonade stand in the desert. It‚Äôs humorous, fun, and pokes fun at ourselves, but also underscores the main message that we need to keep building, because the future belongs to those that keep moving forward.

1. Mainframe was invited to become a member on the advisory board at the Utah Valley University School of Computer Science. We‚Äôre excited to help support computer science education in Utah and to influence blockchain software development.
