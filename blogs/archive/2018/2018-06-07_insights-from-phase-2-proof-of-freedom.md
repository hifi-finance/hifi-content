Insights from Phase 2: Proof of Freedom

Our [Crowdgift Phase 2: Proof Of Freedom](https://blog.mainframe.com/crowdgift-phase-2-proof-of-freedom-5148b4b44be0) has been an incredible ride — we received many more submissions than we anticipated, and ended up putting many more hours and resources into the judging process to make the results as accurate as possible.

As we continue to get everything squared away and ready to reward you with your MFT, we want to remind our community about the guidelines we set in our [original Phase 2 blog post](https://blog.mainframe.com/crowdgift-phase-2-proof-of-freedom-5148b4b44be0) regarding the contest.

We tried to make the rules as clear as possible, but we want to re-emphasize some things here:

1. Many of you submitted multiple entries in the contest, which is fantastic — but know that **each individual is only eligible to receive one award** (hence us awarding the top 100 people Gold, the next 300 people Silver, and the next 600 people Bronze). For anyone with multiple submissions, *you’ll receive only your highest judged award*.

1. At the end of the day, **the Mainframe team has the final say on awards given.** We’ve put on our detective hats over the past few weeks and have discovered a number of fake accounts, duplicate entries, plagiarized submissions, etc. If you’re one of the individuals with multiple accounts and entries, don’t be upset when you only get *only one award*. That’s part of the game.

1. **You may be asked to show proof of your submission** — this could include responding to an email or a PM from someone on our team or it could mean hopping on a Skype call with us in order to verify you’re actually who you say you are.

We’re doing our best to make sure the results of the contest are fair and that as many people get awarded MFT as possible. Through this Crowdgift, we’ve realized just how far the Mainframe community extends. People have participated from all corners of the earth and from all walks of life, and we want to ensure that as many of these Mainframe friends as possible get their share of MFT.
