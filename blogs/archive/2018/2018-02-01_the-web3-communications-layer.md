# The web3 communications layer



During the past few months we have been hard at work clarifying the technical details of our platform, including all the different networking, storage, and data service layers that will be necessary to build robust, user-friendly applications in a fully decentralized way. This work now comes to fruition with the release of our white paper: "[Mainframe: the web3 communications layer](https://mainframe.docsend.com/view/j39qpui)." Read it today!

We begin by describing the problems and weaknesses in the existing communications protocols that currently power the Internet, and why there is such an urgent need for more secure communications, as well as a platform for making all these tools available to Dapp developers.

We then outline how the communications layers use dark routing to achieve censorship and surveillance resistance in addition to encryption. We describe the various protocol layers and how each of them is incentivized in a way that will promote robust and cost-effective services.

The strongest use-cases that we have identified for the platform are outlined, and we describe the first product built for the platform, a messaging application called [Onyx](https://mainframe.com/onyx). We conclude with our development roadmap, listing the major milestones that weâ€™ll be hitting along the way.

The future at Mainframe is bright, and we hope you'll follow along. Don't hesitate to reach out to us on [our Telegram channel](https://t.me/joinchat/Fg15zkUxeHmhSLNEulTSGw) as you read the white paper. We look forward to hearing from you!
