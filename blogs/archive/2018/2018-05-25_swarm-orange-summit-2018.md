Swarm Orange Summit 2018

In lovely Ljubljana, several Mainframe engineers presented on how to continue the work of building out and strengthening Swarm technology. The conference consisted of five days of talks, Q&A, workshops and fun.

We prepared an automated installation for the Onyx mailbox so that conference attendees could chat over Onyx during the conference. The work helped us to hone our infrastructure skills and was a good learning experience.

We also had a great time at the hack session on Friday, where we brainstormed with [Viktor Tron](https://twitter.com/zeligf) and [Louis Holbrook](https://github.com/nolash) on how we could use [mutable resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgvRFsezTI4) to provide native mailboxing services in Swarm for peer-to-peer and group chat applications.

Four members of our engineering team attended, and we gave three talks related to Swarm and how we are leveraging it in the Mainframe platform.

We want to thank the organizers of the conference for their tremendous hospitality and for planning such a stimulating event. It was a blast!

## Carl Youngblood

Carl gave an overview of the [Mainframe platform for decentralized applications](https://blog.mainframe.com/mainframe-a-platform-for-decentralized-applications-a861fd69db0d). His talk covered both the reasons that such a platform is needed, the various features that it will have, and our development roadmap.

## Shane Howley

Shane spoke about [PSST](https://blog.mainframe.com/swarm-summit-presentation-psst-is-anyone-there-8388c417f952), a reliable transport protocol based on PSS (Postal Service over Swarm), a best-effort secure communications protocol used in the Swarm project.

## Doug Leonard

Doug shared insights on [how best to contribute to Swarm](https://blog.mainframe.com/swarm-summit-presentation-how-to-take-over-the-swarm-project-2529240b1d05) based on his experience working on the project so far.
