We‚Äôre thrilled with the submissions, and love the creativity we‚Äôre seeing. Some of our favorites are videos and animated gifs.

Just yesterday we saw tweets incoming from twitter user [**@**identiffi](https://twitter.com/identiffi), who made a series of animated characters to represent the five fundamental principles that underlie the Mainframe network; Encryption, Peer-to-peer Architecture, Dark Routing, Incentivization, and Interoperability.

This is a *totally* unique entry among the thousands we‚Äôve received. It‚Äôs a video, but more of a performance‚Ä¶ and on a personal note, I really dig the music they picked.

Some of the videos are built to be informative, showcasing what Mainframe does and/or how we do it. Great work from the community here.

This one is inspiring. The video plays with the background voice of philosopher Alan Watts speaking on responsibility, the rugged individual, and society. It‚Äôs just a fragment of a much longer talk, but enough to give you the sense of something great.

Some people took a very tangible, hands-on approach by *making* something *physical*, and filming the process. This person made a cake. In fact there were at least [three](https://twitter.com/teresakostin/status/980425601046769664) [people](https://twitter.com/LMcreee/status/984143433689452556) who made Mainframe cakes! Love that sweet taste of freedom. üç∞

Others took the cinematic approach, which is awesome. Who doesn‚Äôt love a great movie? One is a visual metaphor for dark routing, the other a montage of situations showcasing why privacy matters.

We also saw some more visuals that wink to the Mainframe team, especially founder Mick Hagen.

We‚Äôre paying attention, we‚Äôre excited to send MFT your way, and we‚Äôre excited for you to use this awesome technology in your life.
