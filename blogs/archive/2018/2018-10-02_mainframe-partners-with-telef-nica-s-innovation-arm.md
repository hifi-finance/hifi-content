Mainframe Partners with Telefónica’s Innovation Arm

*TLDR: We’ve partnered with the telecommunications giant to help provide decentralized applications for them and their customers.*

We’re excited to announce a partnership that grants Mainframe unique access to Telefónica’s global base of enterprises, affiliates, and 300 million customers, with a signed expectation to secure millions of dollars worth of contracts from these entities.

Telefónica (NYSE: TEF) is a global leader in telecommunications and one of the largest companies in the world, operating in 17 countries under brands like O2, Movistar, Vivo, and many more. They know how vital it is to stay nimble in an evolving digital landscape. Through their innovation arm, Wayra, they’ve chosen Mainframe to develop blockchain solutions for data security, user privacy, and digital freedom. Wayra is committed to scaling creative, driven, and innovative businesses to new heights via the Telefónica network.

“We could not be happier to welcome Mainframe to the family, they have proven that they have what it takes to work with a telecommunications giant and we look forward to seeing what this partnership creates,” said Kym Andrew, CMO of Wayra UK.

This partnership is ideal for Mainframe. Over the next two years, our focus will be on delivering the most robust web3 platform on the planet. Telefónica, and its innovation team, have shared a huge interest in exploring the opportunities of a decentralized application platform that’s resistant to censorship, surveillance, and disruption. We’re thrilled to start working on these game-changing solutions for their entities and clients.

Data security has never been more crucial or threatened. Cybersecurity spending hits record highs every year, with economic damages estimated to reach $6 trillion, annually, by 2021. With looming threats and smarter bad guys, enterprises increasingly recognize the need to adapt and create better digital ecosystems to protect against these vulnerabilities. But to build the apps of the future, privacy and security must be met with performance and functionality.

Mainframe provides a solution that allows any company to build internal applications that secure and privatize data. From finance to social media to protection of IP, the use cases are virtually limitless. Applications that harness the full power of the private and secure Mainframe platform will fuel the businesses of the future.

This bold partnership reflects our ongoing efforts to provide solutions for all who need security, convenience, and control over the applications we rely on more than ever. We’re hungry to distribute the unparalleled value of a bulletproof network to everyone as we forge the web3 future. We look forward to collaboration in the years to come with deep and abiding partnerships as we take the Mainframe movement to the globe.
