With everything that’s happened over 48 hours — token distro, Binance listing, and a HUGE inflow of new fans to the Mainframe community, we want to extend an official welcome to all the newcomers!

There are a lot of misconceptions about what Mainframe is. In the coming months, we hope you’ll come to appreciate the scope and ambition of what we’re building. Mainframe is not a chat app. It’s not even just a communications layer. It’s an architecture for a new internet.

Our dark routing, unique network design, and other encryption layers combines to provide a surveillance and censorship resistance that is unparalleled. It allows developers to create and deploy unstoppable and untrackable applications, on any blockchain or network.

It’s a platform for everyone, where no one can arrest our thoughts and ideas. It means we can choose how we communicate and what we share. It’s an end to authoritarian control of information and technology. It’s the beginning of true freedom and privacy.

**What we are building has never been done before. **The token can already be utilized on Onyx, but the full realization of this vision will take time. And we will continue to deliver like we always have. Welcome to the team!
