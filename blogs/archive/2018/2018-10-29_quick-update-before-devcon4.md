Quick Update before DevCon4

*TLDR: This is an email update I just sent to all our pre-sale participants (but that our entire community should see)*

I’m 35k feet above the Atlantic Ocean right now on my way to Madrid for a quick biz dev meeting before I continue to Prague for DevCon. Below is an email I just sent to our pre-sale participants. They aren’t any more important or special than every other token holder — I just happen to know their email addresses. I want our entire community to see this update on what we’ve done recently. Feel free to [ping me](https://twitter.com/mickhagen) with any questions that you have. *I’ve added some embedded media in this post to make it easier to follow*.

To our fantastic pre-sale participants,

Just wanted to send a note before the craziness of [DevCon](https://devcon4.ethereum.org/) occurs next week. Here are the key updates/announcements. It should be no surprise that we continue to execute like maniacs on a mission… because that’s exactly what we are. :)

* We’re hosting the [Dapp Awards](https://da18.mainframe.com/) during DevCon. [Blog post](https://blog.mainframe.com/announcing-the-dapp-awards-5664a7368c90). We’re only letting the elite builders/founders and other industry leaders attend — and most of them have confirmed they will attend. Expect more events like this where we continue to build our leadership, credibility and authority around the dapp ecosystem. Tell us asap if you want to attend the Dapp Awards as we’re already way over capacity.

* We have some big plans for 2019. Super aggressive moves. If you are around at DevCon, let’s find a time to sit down and catch up so we can share some of the roadmap. Please respond to this email so we can coordinate a time.

* A few days ago I had a [private meeting](https://twitter.com/Mainframe_HQ/status/1055909970871492610) with US Congressman John Curtis. He’s eager to learn and understand blockchain technology, and how it can unlock economic opportunities for Americans and people all over the world. We discussed blockchain technology and what the US government needed to do to remain competitive, *not* stifle innovation, and be welcoming to entrepreneurs. He spent a lot more time with me than I expected and [I was impressed](https://twitter.com/mickhagen/status/1055923163299606528) with his desire to really understand the challenges and opportunities. Some [other](https://twitter.com/mickhagen/status/1055999049654910976) [comments](https://twitter.com/mickhagen/status/1056063473220648962) on Twitter. A lot more collaboration coming here.

* We [announced a major partnership](https://blog.mainframe.com/mainframe-partners-with-telef%C3%B3nicas-innovation-arm-644bf9580046) with Telefonica a few weeks ago. They will leverage our technology to build products for their 300 Million customers. Telefonica is one of the top 100 companies in the world, over $50B in revenue. Major player. Major announcement. A lot more strong biz dev like this in the pipeline.

* Our engineering team continues to #buidl. [September tech update](https://blog.mainframe.com/mainframe-product-update-september-207bc2b1cb14). Interactive [roadmap](https://mainframe.com/roadmap/). You can see our weekly engineering roundtables on our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOhQaYVAUypRWHucouG3Sjg/videos). Blog post sharing more about the [architecture of our platform](https://blog.mainframe.com/building-the-mainframe-platform-b0b775ee4981). And [Erebos](https://blog.mainframe.com/introducing-erebos-a-javascript-client-and-cli-for-swarm-356a59595916), a javascript client for Swarm, is already becoming the most popular Swarm library among developers in ecosystem. The significance of 0.1 internal release means we have cleared the bottleneck for development of reference dApps, adding new service layers, and incorporating new UI.

* We continue to [build community](https://blog.mainframe.com/kickstarting-developer-meetups-and-other-events-f268c7ce41d6) all over the world. We’re focusing our efforts on developers — not airdrops. Our [meetup in Sao Paulo](https://twitter.com/Mainframe_HQ/status/1052598018002698241) had over 90% developers in attendance (Carl and I gave our presentations in Portuguese — yes we speak fluently). Similar developer attendance at our [meetup in Salt Lake City](https://twitter.com/shmula/status/1055277998536974336), where we invited leaders from Tezos (finalizing deeper partnership/collaboration with them). [Spoke](https://twitter.com/Mainframe_HQ/status/1049469174488027136) at SF Blockchain week. Did a [meetup in SF](https://twitter.com/Mainframe_HQ/status/1049716137074651136) with Taylor Monahan from MyCrypto. More in the pipeline. The movement continues to grow.

* A Utah Business Magazine [listed Mainframe](https://utahvalley360.com/2018/10/11/uv50-startups-to-watch-no-2-mainframe/) as their №2 “Startup to Watch” in the annual list of local business successes.

* Austin Craig (our head of marketing) gave a [strong presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q2r4LJ414c&t=1136s) on “How Cryptocurrency helped the starfish beat the spider” at a [Crypto Anarchist Conference](https://neworder.hcpp.cz/) — it was a talk about decentralized organizations.

* Austin is just one example, but we really do have the best team in the industry. Watch [this team video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAWkjEGQoI4). And please keep sending us your best people. We optimize for raw talent, hustle, resilience, and curiosity. We are not as concerned about years of experience or educational background. We are on the frontiers — we need gritty, scrappy fighters.

* Some of my comments have been in the press recently. I share [some commentary](https://www.blockasia.io/mainframe-the-chinese-regulators-are-still-grasping-the-philosophy-of-blockchain/) around China’s proposed blockchain regulation wrt identity. I have a [strong response](https://blocktribune.com/nouriel-roubini-slams-blockchain-and-crypto-before-senate-industry-reacts/) to the nonsense that Nouriel Roubini spewed during the senate committee hearings. I talk about importance of [owning your own data](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-data-is-worth-billions-and-you-soon-might-be-able-to-get-a-cut-of-it-2018-10-09) and how that becomes more possible with blockchain technology.

* I’m [pumped](https://twitter.com/mickhagen/status/1053390451825209344) and ready to take things to the next level. Let’s [go](https://media.giphy.com/media/KpKayhnOiSw4o/giphy.gif)!!!!

That’s all for now. If you don’t grind, you don’t shine.

Cheers,
Mick
