Crowdgift Phase 2: Proof of Freedom

*TLDR: We‚Äôre giving away more than $1M to the people who can best answer the question, ‚ÄúWhy does Mainframe and its mission matter to you?‚Äù We‚Äôre fine if nobody sees your response except us ‚Äî this is **not** ‚ÄúProof of Shill‚Äù!*

***UPDATE**: The submission deadline has been announced. Read [this blog post](https://blog.mainframe.com/proof-of-freedom-phase-2-deadline-announced-c72a0e67234).*

In case you missed our [Phase 1: Proof of Being](https://medium.com/p/3591a7f52475/edit) we are literally doing an airdrop with physical tokens in locations all over the world. If you missed our [Crowdsale Introduction](https://medium.com/p/9a73ea7ae9d4/edit) and the [Three Million Dollars](https://medium.com/@mickhagen/three-million-dollars-53ccc72f3444) post, please go read. Phase 3 of our Crowdgift (our final phase) will be announced soon.

Now for *Phase 2: Proof of Freedom*. Here we go‚Ä¶

You don‚Äôt need to be in any physical location for this. You can be anywhere and everywhere. You can be in your mom‚Äôs basement wearing only underwear or in your corporate cubicle wearing a suit and tie. We don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt discriminate where you are, where you are from, or what language you speak. This does not require shilling Mainframe. This only requires your mind, some effort, and some originality.

## **Our Question**
> **Why does Mainframe and its mission matter to you?**

That‚Äôs the question you must answer. You can answer it however you want. But answer it you must. Be sure to read [our White Paper](https://mainframe.docsend.com/view/j39qpui) and all [our recent blog posts](https://blog.mainframe.com/) to make sure you understand what our ‚Äúmission‚Äù actually is (hint: privacy & freedom!). It must be clear that you aren‚Äôt just talking about privacy and freedom, but specifically how Mainframe will play its part, how Mainframe will impact the world and your world specifically. Feel free to also share ideas, potential use-cases and applications that can built on the Mainframe network.

## Selection Criteria

*We are not asking you to shill Mainframe*. That‚Äôs what many other projects do and we aren‚Äôt interested in that. We simply want to find the people who are sincerely and genuinely excited about what we‚Äôre doing. We want to give tokens to the people who are believers in our cause, in our mission, in our movement. It‚Äôs that simple. Here are the primary factors we‚Äôll be judging:

* *Creativity and originality*: we would love to see something that really stands out from the crowd. Impress us. Surprise us. Amuse us. Inspire us. Do something that grabs our attention and makes us believe that you are part of this mission.

* *Authenticity*: we want to give tokens to the people who *we believe* genuinely and sincerely care about Mainframe. We want to weed out the the scalpers and speculators ‚Äî they aren‚Äôt interested in us, we aren‚Äôt interested in them. Prove to us you actually care about privacy and freedom. Prove to us you actually want to be with us for the long term.

We won‚Äôt judge your response by how many times it is shared or how far it gets spread. As we‚Äôve said, this isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúshilling‚Äù anything. This is about us having a way to judge how important Mainframe and our cause is to you. We want to know if you are a true believer or not.

## Judging

The Mainframe team will be the ultimate judges. We would love to hear feedback from the community if a specific response really touches them and makes an impact on them, but we have the ultimate say as to who wins.

We will be vigilant about scammers!
