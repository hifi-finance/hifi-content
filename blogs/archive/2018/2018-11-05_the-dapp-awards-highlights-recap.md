# The Dapp Awards — Highlights & Recap

We had a fantastic time hosting the Dapp Awards last week. It was an evening to celebrate and honor the doers, makers, creators and buidlers. The event was a packed house with founders, developers, and executives from leading projects in the space. Below is a recap of the night.

## **The Setup**

The event was at Czech Museum of Music in Prague. Our team did a great job booking the venue and getting the whole place setup for a fantastic night. The decor, the swag, the food, the lighting, the side accessories like the photo booth… it was a high-class setup for a high-class event.

## **The Keynote**

I delivered the keynote address. I’ll write a blog post later with a more comprehensive recap of my remarks. But my main message was to the [#buidlers](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/buidlers?source=feed_text). I talked a lot about the WHY. Why we are in the space. What it means. The impact we can have. The vision we should have. It can be boiled down to one word: **freedom**.

There are many shapes and sizes of freedom but the freedom that I talked about and the one I’m most excited about is economic freedom.

Freedom for entrepreneurs, builders, makers, creators to participate in a global economy — one where trade sanctions, government censorship or bureaucracy simply won’t get in the way. Freedom for people of all skills to open a dapp, to contribute and help cultivate new micro-economies — working, earning, saving and providing. A global, digital marketplace that transcends jurisdictions. Freedom from the local corruption, oppression or incompetence that often stands in the way in many parts of the developing world. Freedom to provide for one’s family. Freedom to build a small business. Freedom to build an empire. Freedom to change the world, because now you truly have access to it.

Economic freedom creates a more fertile ground for democracy and better societies. If you have economic freedom you create conditions for so much more (less crime, less poverty, etc). You allow people to take destiny into their own hands… to create their own luck, to create their own opportunities, and to create their own prosperity.

Brilliance is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. Web3 changes that. Expect to hear a lot more from me on this subject.

## **Dawn of the Dapps Video**

We did the full screening of our Dawn of the Dapps video. Based on the laughs, I think it was a hit! We had previously released [the teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7xucSg5n8U) and that caused quite a bit of chatter on social media. Below is an example of the type of responses we saw. Click through to see the replies.

## The Emcee

Austin Craig is not only a star in our [Dawn of the Dapps video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7xucSg5n8U) (see above), but he’s a star wherever he takes the stage. Austin (Head of Marketing at Mainframe) was the emcee for the event. He helped the program move along (even when there were minor hiccups), performed a hilarious skit with Doug (costar in the Dawn of the Dapps video), and delivered a fiery speech at the end. Great work Austin!
