$1.4M raised for charity in ‚ÄúProof of Heart‚Äù

What a wild ride it‚Äôs been! [Phase 3](https://blog.mainframe.com/crowdgift-phase-3-proof-of-heart-6e6c1557610) of our [Crowdgift](https://blog.mainframe.com/three-million-dollars-53ccc72f3444) has finally come to an end, and we are proud to announce that our amazing community has raised over [$1.4 million dollars](https://etherscan.io/address/0x34c5bf6ce9fecbd10bcfafdf60c61ed27533473b) for non-profit organizations that align with our values around privacy and freedom.

We are inspired and amazed at the generosity displayed by our community. We had no idea that we‚Äôd raise $1.4M for these great causes. Our community has proven they have incredible heart. Thank you. üôè

In the coming weeks we will announce the specific non-profit organizations that we will be donating to. We are in active discussion with many of them and we‚Äôre excited to unveil who they are soon!

## Thank You Gift

In our [original ‚ÄúProof of Heart‚Äù blog](https://blog.mainframe.com/crowdgift-phase-3-proof-of-heart-6e6c1557610) post we mentioned that everyone who donated above 0.5 ETH (and who did not win a prize) would be given a special ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù gift.

***The Thank You Gift will be 0.25 ETH of MFT. ***We really do thank you. You are amazing. We were originally planning on 0.1 ETH of MFT but we were so impressed with the generosity and heart of our community that we decided to return that same heart and generosity.

## The Mini-Contests

We also held over a dozen fun and quirky little mini-contests for people in our Telegram communities. We wanted to make sure that our most active and engaged community members had a shot at winning some prizes, even if they weren‚Äôt big whales who could drop a lot of ETH on the main contest. Below are a few examples:

**‚ÄúI heart Mainframe‚Äôs Whitepaper‚Äù Quiz** 
We gave out 25 bronze prizes for the fastest correct answers to questions related to our white paper. Each answer would have a corresponding ETH amount. The first 5 people on each question to send in the correct ETH amount into our donation wallet would win. Here‚Äôs an example of a question below.
> **QUESTION**: When receiving data packets from a sender on the mainframe network, What is the term used to describe how specific or scattered a recipients address is?
> 1) Laser targeting ‚Üí 0.40 ETH
2) Obscurity ‚Üí 0.41 ETH
3) Shade ‚Üí 0.42 ETH
4) Location lock ‚Üí 0.43 ETH
5) Luminosity ‚Üí 0.44 ETH

**‚ÄúWe love our fish‚Äù Mini-contest**
We awarded 10 bronze prizes to the first 10 donors of any amount over 0.1ETH that drew a picture of Mainframe‚Äôs logo and took a selfie (or non-self picture for the privacy conscious). We had a lot of fun with this one. Here are a few examples. :)

**‚ÄúBerlin Wall‚Äù Mini-contest**
We awarded 25 bronze prizes to the first 25 donors to send in 0.1989 ETH in honor of the year the Berlin Wall fell.

**‚ÄúNelson Mandela‚Äù Mini-contest**
We awarded 20 bronze prizes in a small lottery to winning donors who contributed 0.1990 ETH within a timeframe of 1990 seconds (in honor of the year Mandela was released from prison).

**‚ÄúGutenberg‚Äù Mini-contest**
We awarded 25 silver prizes in a lottery to winning donors who contributed 0.1440 ETH (in honor of Gutenberg‚Äôs invention of the printing press in Europe)

We will have a lot more to announce very, very soon. We promise that this $1.4M will be put to very good use. Whether you won or lost, we hope that you are proud of the great work we‚Äôve done together as a community. To many of the non-profit organizations who we‚Äôre planning on donating this to, this is an incredible amount of funding that will have a long-lasting impact on their organization. They are pumped to be receiving this donation. Thank you! We have the best community! ‚ù§Ô∏è
