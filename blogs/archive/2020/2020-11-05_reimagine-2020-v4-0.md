### **A recap of “Tales from the Crypt(o)”**

During ReImagine’s “Tales from the Crypt(o)” interview, [Doug Leonard](undefined) answers questions from Yonah Hochhauser covering everything from Mainframe’s Lending Protocol to his scariest crypto story.

### **What’s the difference between fixed-rate and stable-rate?**

[The possibility of your rate changing.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=113)

### **How are you able to guarantee a fixed-rate in a volatile crypto market?**

[Debt settles on a certain date and is pegged to a stable coin.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=151)

### **Why do other platforms go with a stable rate instead of a fixed rate?**

[Variable-rate protocols took root first because they require less user interaction.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=203)

### **Is the era of yield farming over?**

[I don’t think it’s over.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=280)

### **How can a protocol attract liquidity? How is Mainframe going to attract users?**

[The teams who actually put their names on the code and innovate will come out on top.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=441)

### **When you go live on Mainnet, are you going to be sleepless that first night?**

[I hope not.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=705)

### **Where do you fall on the Paypal development with crypto?**

[Hopefully, PayPal can grow awareness of crypto on a larger scale.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=1150)

### **Is Paypal going to buy actual bitcoin? Or is it all going to be just a price peg?**

[My guess would be, yes, they will buy and hold bitcoin.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=1346)

### **Do you foresee Paypal entering and utilizing some of these lending protocols? Or do you see them actually building their own competitor?**

[We know that Paypal is looking at exploring purchasing some crypto institutions.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=1521)

### **If Paypal buys and holds bitcoin, they could flood the market with Bitcoin lending; will that affect your protocol?**

[Not in the short term.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=1756)

### **What are your thoughts on flash loans?**

[The world doesn’t work on block time.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=1995)

### **Is there a loser in the flash loan system?**

[The potential loser would be the person who’s actually running the function.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=2196)

### **Are there overall market imbalances or inefficiencies that can lead to opportunities to make money?**

[Yes, we’ve already seen this.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=2485)

### **Do these types of arbitrage trading transactions shift more power towards the miners?**

[Miners will be able to have some opportunity for performing the work they do.](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=2648)

### **What is your scariest crypto story?**

[An experience I had during Mainframe’s ICO and distributing a few too many tokens to a handful of presale participants](https://youtu.be/T3nfnzvQips?t=2800).
