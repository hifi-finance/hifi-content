New Chapter, New CEO

### Doug Leonard will be replacing me as the CEO of Mainframe. You can also read [Doug’s letter here](https://blog.mainframe.com/shareholder-letter-february-2020-36fdb310a82d).

Today marks the beginning of the next chapter for the Mainframe ecosystem we’ve all worked so hard to build together. Doug Leonard will be replacing me as the CEO of [Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/). He will be responsible and accountable for leading Mainframe to the next level. My focus will be as CEO of [Genesis Block](https://genesisblock.com/), a new digital banking product that is leveraging decentralized protocols and crypto.

Right now is the perfect time for this transition. Mainframe is the healthiest it has been in a long time. From a financial standpoint, it has about two years of runway. I put my heart and soul into writing the [new white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G_Mpq2xRlojkCseactAXu2WSUmDR6lzS0Kybvcd-UUw/edit) and making sure our [vision, direction and strategy](https://blog.mainframe.com/mainframe-credit-protocol-unlocking-economic-freedom-financial-access-for-all-753a9590692f) was set. It is now firmly set and Doug will carry the baton from here. Doug has my full confidence and will be a fantastic CEO. To get a flavor of what’s to come, just read [his recent letter](https://blog.mainframe.com/shareholder-letter-february-2020-36fdb310a82d) to our employees, shareholders, pre-sale participants, MFT holders and community.

**Focused Leadership**

This separation of roles and responsibilities will ensure that both Genesis Block and Mainframe are setup for maximum success. The Mainframe project sits at the heart/core of blockchain with $MFT and the protocol it powers. And Genesis Block is a company operating at the edges with focus on an end-user product, compliance and interacting with regulators and financial institutions. They each are big enough opportunities that they each need focused, full-time, committed leaders at the helm. Yet, I still firmly believe that working together these two organizations will be unstoppable.

From [my last blog post](https://blog.mainframe.com/mainframe-credit-protocol-unlocking-economic-freedom-financial-access-for-all-753a9590692f):
> Genesis Block will leverage the Mainframe Credit Protocol in a very big way. This protocol and the Genesis Block app are highly complimentary. It all fits together nicely in the bigger vision of Economic Freedom.

I remain deeply committed to Mainframe for the long term. I’m still the Founder, Chairman of the Board, largest shareholder, and one of the largest MFT hodlers (if not the largest). I plan to work closely with Doug during this transition and beyond. We have so many areas of mutual interest — decentralized finance and economic freedom are just the tip of the iceberg.

**Doug is the right guy**

Doug comes with experience and a deep passion for decentralized technology. He came to us as one of our earliest engineering hires. He is the individual we trusted to deploy MFT to the Ethereum mainnet during our Token Generation Event. In our time together, Doug made the transition from engineer to Mainframe’s Head of Strategy. He helped point us towards our current focus of decentralized finance (#DeFi). Doug had early experiences in DeFi, notably financing his families minivan purchase with a Maker CDP. He’s constantly learning, experimenting and hacking. I especially enjoyed his breeding of cryptokitties in an attempt to create the purrfect racing specimen. Doug’s technical abilities are complemented by his career in the startup space and other executive leadership roles he’s fulfilled as a co-founder in previous ventures.

**Wrap Up**

Onboarding Doug into this role enables us to give more dedicated attention to the Mainframe Credit Protocol and $MFT token utility — something our ecosystem needs right now. It will also allow me to focus on launching Genesis Block — the first regulatory-compliant consumer product that will leverage the Mainframe Credit Protocol. As sister companies, both Mainframe and Genesis Block benefit from each other’s success.

I am confident in Doug and hope you will join me in supporting him. Over the coming weeks he will begin introducing foundational changes to increase community engagement, token utilization, and protect Mainframe’s long term sustainability. The opportunity will be your’s to participate in this process, and so I hope you come hungry for change and growth.

Doug and I will do a [live AMA](https://youtu.be/oKtXxSKqtVI) this Wednesday, February 12th at 10 AM MST. Bring your questions for either one of us and we will dive deeper into any of the details you’d like to explore.
