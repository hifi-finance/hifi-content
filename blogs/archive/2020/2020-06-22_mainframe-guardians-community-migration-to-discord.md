# Mainframe Guardians & Community Migration to Discord



Mainframe Guardians is an exclusive group of the most active advocates within our community. These members will act as community ambassadors across our social channels, contributing to conversations that promote the Mainframe Lending Protocol.

**Migrating to Discord**
Discord offers our community a more structured and organized way to engage. We hope this decision will promote a broader set of conversations and orient new members of our community quickly. [Click here to join our new Discord channel.](https://discord.gg/mhtSRz6) In the coming week our existing Telegram Groups will be shut down. For a short period the team will use them as announcement only channels.

As we rebuild our community and promote a constructive environment for discussion, both the Guardian Program and the migration to Discord will play a foundational role. If you have been active in DeFi communities for the past few years, you likely can recall Havven (now Synthetix) making [similar community restructuring decisions](https://blog.synthetix.io/announcement-havven-guardians-ambassador-program-online-channel-migration/) at the end of 2018.
