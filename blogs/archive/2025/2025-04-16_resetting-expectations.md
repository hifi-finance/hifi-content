Resetting Expectations

We do not see a viable path forward and believe that you deserve to know.

Considering recent events and our future outlook, we simply do not have the resources necessary to deliver on the promises made in the recently proposed roadmap. For this reason, we will be returning the full 25,000,000 HIFI tokens to the DAO and let governance decide on the best path forward.

### So what does this mean, and what can you expect?

It means that we will not be moving forward with the audit or deliverables of Hifi v3, nor will we pursue final SEC approval for Crown Ribbon. All ongoing development and marketing efforts will stop. However, we remain committed to overseeing and managing existing obligations to ensure funds are smoothly returned to the protocol and DAO. We will also work with borrowers of longer-dated loans to explore the possibility of refinancing their obligations elsewhere.

It is our judgment that there are two essential requirements for Hifi to succeed. One, there must be a dedicated team to coordinate, maintain, promote, and administer to the protocol and DAO needs. And, two, there must be liquidity within the protocol. We no longer believe that we can deliver both of these essential ingredients for Hifiâ€™s success.

Regardless of what lies ahead, there are important matters for the DAO to decide and vote on. We know that this blog post creates more questions than it answers, but anything else, including silence, would feel disingenuous at best. Now is the time to come together as a community and collaborate on the best path forward.
