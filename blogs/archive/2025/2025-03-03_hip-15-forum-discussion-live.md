HIP 15 Forum Discussion Live

The discussion forum for [**Hifi Improvement Proposal 15](https://forum.hifi.finance/t/hip-15-service-contract-renewal-final-v2-market-deployment/483)** is now live! **HIP 15** proposes two key updates:

1. **Renewing the Service Contract** with Mainframe Group, Inc. for another two-year term (Dec 1, 2024 â€” Dec 1, 2026), maintaining the same structure and terms established in HIP 2. This renewal includes allocating 25 million HIFI tokens, vesting linearly over the contract period.

1. **Deploying One Final Market on Hifi v2** that will expire on **June 27, 2025**, ensuring uninterrupted borrowing and lending for our community until the transition to Hifi v3 is complete.

By extending the [existing service contract](https://snapshot.box/#/s:hifi-finance.eth/proposal/0x94b8dd5dc839ea0528c993f3be0eba9a26f2d9a91fa885ea19596a90ad3425f0), the Hifi DAO secures the continuity of essential development, security, marketing, and operational services. Simultaneously, a final Hifi v2 market will let users smoothly bridge their positions to v3 once the upgraded version is audited, finalized, and rolled out.

We encourage all DAO members to review and share their insights on this proposal before it moves to a vote. The proposal will be published on [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao) within the next few days, and voting will open 48 hours afterward.

## Important Reminders

* **Self-Custody for Governance**: If you hold Hifi tokens on a centralized exchange, move them to a self-custody wallet (e.g., [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.network/)) to participate in governance.

* **Check Your Delegation**: [Confirm your tokens are delegated](https://www.tally.xyz/user/connect?wallet=&redirect=%2Fgov%2Fhifi-dao%2Fmy-voting-power) to maximize your voting power.
