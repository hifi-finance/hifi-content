HIP 16 Voting Live

Governance voting for [Hifi Improvement Proposal 16](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/15) is officially open on Tally. This proposal aims to establish a clear baseline strategy for the Hifi DAO to ensure stability and clarity without any other viable alternatives. This includes financial resource allocation, collateral updates, Decentralized Exchange liquidity efforts, and provisions for a potential future wind-down.

## Vote Timeline

The vote will remain open for five days. If quorum is reached and the proposal is approved, implementation of the outlined changes will begin. If it fails, no action will be taken, though revised versions of the proposal may be submitted in the future.
