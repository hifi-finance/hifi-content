Mainframe & Brasil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

Many of you have noticed that weâ€™ve been traveling more frequently to Brasil in the last 6â€“9 months. Weâ€™ve shared publicly that weâ€™ve opened an office in SÃ£o Paulo, but we havenâ€™t shared much detail beyond that. Having just gotten back from a great trip last week, I thought Iâ€™d share more.

### **Why Brasil?**

I personally lived in Brasil for two years during my early 20â€™s. I speak fluent Portuguese. I love the country and the people. Talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. One place thatâ€™s become abundantly clear to me is Brasil. Itâ€™s a country that is so rich in culture, creativity, talent, drive and potential. Yet, due to a lot of different factors (economic, political, etc), they just havenâ€™t been given the same opportunities.

But that hasnâ€™t stopped them. Brazilians are scrappy and resilient. They are hackers in every sense of the word â€” always finding ways to beat the odds and overcome broken systems. Brazilians work through challenges with joy and delight â€” and they work hard. We have learned that first-hand working with various Brasil-based dev partners and then with our first native Brazilian employee, Diogo Perillo (originally from Belo Horizonte). He is one of the most reliable and talented front-end developers Iâ€™ve ever worked with.

### Our Past Visits

Last year we traveled to many different cities in Brasil â€” speaking at events, organizing Mainframe meetups, participating in hackathons and more. We wanted to better get to know the different startup/blockchain communities in Brasil and evaluate where we should open an office. In the end we opened our office in SÃ£o Paulo. That decision was difficult â€” there are so many amazing startups and entrepreneurs all over Brasil helping build web3. They are tackling major, real-world problems that are native to their country. I think we could have chosen a few different cities. The Decentralized Web can and will have a major impact on the country of Brasil. Like so many other parts of the world â€”young Brazilians have a growing distrust for government leaders, financial institutions, media companies and more. We love the rhythm and pace of SÃ£o Paulo â€” itâ€™s a big city filled with hungry, driven and ambitious people. Constant movement. Perfect for our first Brazilian office.

### Current Team

We now have a team of 4 talented people working from our SÃ£o Paulo office (currently in Spaces Vila Madalena coworking space in the Pinheiros neighborhood). Willian comes to Mainframe with years of full-stack experience and valuable blockchain expertise; Robson is a great engineer, big-picture thinker, and certified Product Owner; Guilherme is a talented web applications developer critical to implementing the uncompromising UX & polished design Mainframe is famous for; and Babi covers product management, marketing, and operations. Together they bring valuable experience from the world of fintech, payments, banking, and blockchain. We couldnâ€™t ask for a better combination of skills, talents, and personalities. They are excited and committed to help Mainframe pursue the promise of web3. Our office in Brasil is just getting started â€” if youâ€™re interested please reach out to us.

Last week we had a wonderful time in SÃ£o Paulo with the entire Mainframe OS development team. We had strong product, marketing, strategy and technical discussions throughout the week. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been more excited and optimistic about the future of Mainframe OS, and the future of Mainframe in Brasil. I canâ€™t wait to share more when the time is right!

Cheers, 
Mick
