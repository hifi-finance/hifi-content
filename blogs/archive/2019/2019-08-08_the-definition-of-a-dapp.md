The Definition of a Dapp

*Decentralized apps should mean more than just a smart contract built on top of the old problematic web2 technology*

One of our [FAQs](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/faq) is around our definition of a dapp (Web3 Decentralized Application). It’s true, we define “dapp” a little differently than most. Typically, any web application that interacts with a blockchain or smart contract is called a “dapp”. While the blockchain transactions are indeed decentralized, and the data & event models can be decentralized if the developer chooses to leverage smart contracts instead of centralized data solutions, access to the application itself is not decentralized and there is nothing stopping developers from integrating any number of centralized features. You still have to go to a centralized website to access it, and running inside a traditional browser there is very little transparency into http connections or data transferred while you’re there. Those “dapps” are just as able as any problematic web2 application to be censored or single points of failure, access user data without permission, or expose users to inherent web2 vulnerabilities.

At Mainframe we believe that an application should only be called “decentralized” if it doesn’t live on a web server, can’t be accessed through a traditional browser, doesn’t store anything in a centralized database, and gives users full control over their own data and complete visibility into what’s happening behind the scenes. Only then can users reclaim control, apps become unstoppable, and the full potential of web3 technology be unlocked.

But… we know as well as anyone that building anything unstoppable and trustless on top of today’s distributed networks is extremely complex, and using those apps is even harder. The new paradigm and underlying technology is immature and can be difficult to understand, complicated to integrate, and sometimes unpredictable.

Mainframe OS is a platform that makes it easy for end-users to find and use dapps, and for developers to build and deploy dapps.

**Unstoppable**

Mainframe OS offers a different and unstoppable way to deploy and use dapps. Dapps are not published or accessed in the traditional way from a web server that is vulnerable to attack and is a single point of failure. Once a dapp is published in Mainframe OS, it’s out there in the immutable decentralized [Swarm](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) network and cannot be “stopped” (i.e. deleted, censored, blocked, etc). We provide a mechanism for dapp developers to deploy updates to a published dapp and for users to easily upgrade, but even then, the old versions actually are still out there.

**Privacy**

Users stay in control of their sensitive personal data by leveraging the integrated wallet, identity, and contacts utilities in Mainframe OS. Dapps can access this information only through the Mainframe OS SDK APIs. In this way users can efficiently manage that personal data on a system level and then effectively control access to it.

**Transparency**

Users install dapps to their local devices and run them inside a controlled execution environment that notifies them of any external http connections or data accessed. They can whitelist sites and grant permission to trusted dapps for specific data access, or revoke at any time.

**Taking decentralization to the next level**

Easy access to decentralized services including blockchain functions, payments, encrypted data storage, (and on the [roadmap](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/roadmap), communications) through the Mainframe SDK, empowers developers to think about deeper levels of decentralization without getting hung up on infrastructure integration details. This is why we say Mainframe is laser-focused on benefiting both the developer and the end-user.

**Mainframe Apps**

Mainframe OS comes pre-built with several dapps. Some are intended for exploration, inspiration, and reference. Others give access to cutting-edge defi protocols. In the following weeks you’ll see us posting *dapp walk-throughs*, that intend to show you how each dapp works and how to use Mainframe OS to create your own dapps.

Here are the dapps we have right now:

**CDP-Pro**: arguably the easiest way to create and manage a MakerDAO CDP.

**Compounded**: easy way to access Compound’s protocols to earn interest on ETH or DAI.

**Payments**: a simple app that facilitates sending ETH or MFT to integrated contacts

**Noted**: a text editor that stores encrypted notes in the decentralized Swarm network.

**CDP Portal**: the popular MakerDAO CDP dapp, ported to Mainframe OS

**Uniswap**: the popular exchange dapp, ported to Mainframe OS

**Looper**: leverage your assets (using Instadapps smart contracts)

[Download](https://mainframeos.com/) & install Mainframe OS, and access these *Suggested Apps* from the Applications tab. They are simple to install, use, and update. Or use the [developer guide](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/build-dapps) to create, install, and share your own dapps.

We are firm believers in the power of decentralization, and are putting our energy and resources behind that vision. Feel free to reach out to us on [gitter](http://community.mainframe.com) for any questions or support, or to continue the dapp conversation.
