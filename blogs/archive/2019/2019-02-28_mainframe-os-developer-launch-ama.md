Mainframe OS Developer Launch & AMA

After receiving [amazing feedback from ETHDenver](https://blog.mainframe.com/update-on-mainframe-os-v0-2-public-release-55d0ca1876c7), we’re excited to announce that next Tuesday we’ll be releasing our Mainframe OS Developer version. Developers will immediately be able to build and deploy dapps on the Mainframe platform, leveraging the [Mainframe SDK](https://github.com/MainframeHQ/mainframe-os). Some developers have [already started](https://twitter.com/lukaskorba/status/1098329094272487432) while we’re still resolving some of the last technical issues.

***The public launch of Mainframe OS is still planned for early April*.** The entire onboarding UX will be polished and ready for end-users, and there will be a killer dapp available for the public to start interacting with.

As part of the launch next week, we will host a live video AMA with myself, Sarah Wiley (VP of Engineering) and Neil Bly (VP of Product).

**Details on our Video AMA**
**When**: Wednesday, March 6
**Time**: 9:30am Mountain Time (MT)
**Where**: Our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MainframeHQ)
