Mainframe OS: support for Mac, Windows, & Linux now live!

Today we are releasing an update to Mainframe OS (v0.3.1) that includes improvements to the installer, support for additional platforms, stability to the Swarm network, SDK and UI enhancements, and updated apps. This comes quickly on the heals of our public release 3 weeks ago and is driven by great feedback, troubleshooting, and alpha testing results we’ve heard from users.

**Installer:** The big news is we can now support users on Mac, Linux, and Windows platforms with a standard one-click installation experience. (No more environment setup script. Yay!) This streamlined installer and additional platform support will make Mainframe OS accessible to a large segment of new users.

**Swarm network:** In conjunction with this release, we have now re-routed mainframe-gateways.net to use a private network of Mainframe-managed Swarm nodes that are pegged to vetted compatible and stable Swarm versions. At this time the nodes are all operating Swarm v0.3.8, and are distributed across several AWS regions and availability zones. Ultimately this means installing and publishing apps, as well as connecting with Mainframe OS users as contacts, should be more reliable. Mainframe OS remains committed to the ideals of decentralization, and continues to work closely with the Swarm team to improve the public network. We will keep our private network of Swarm nodes updated as new releases are available and tested, and will transition to the public network once Swarm has a beta release available.

**SDK enhancements:** Several bug fixes and new features are available in the Mainframe OS Web3 client, and the blockchain and storage SDK APIs. See [closed PRs](https://github.com/MainframeHQ/mainframe-os/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) (between April17 and May5) on github for specifics.

**App updates:** With the updates to the storage SDK APIs as well as the stabilized Swarm network mentioned above, we’re releasing an update to the Noted reference app so it actually uses encrypted decentralized storage now. We are also releasing new versions of all the Suggested Apps since previous releases were not correctly installing for all users. (Don’t worry early adopters, we’ll release a way to clean up your previously installed apps soon!)

**UI enhancements:** Most notably, downloaded and installed apps and pre-built developer apps can now run and render correctly in Windows and Linux environments. The release also includes a few other miscellaneous UI tweaks.

## Mainframe OS Roadmap

We are currently working to update the published [roadmap](https://mainframe.com/roadmap/) for Mainframe OS. In the near future, we are exploring new features in wallets, onboarding, managing apps, vault/identity management, MFT integration for app submissions and gas payments, communications protocols and APIs in the SDK, some new reference and user apps, and improvements in the infrastructure layers that will make Mainframe OS even more robust, functional, and future-proof for end-users. Exciting things are on the horizon for Mainframe OS!
