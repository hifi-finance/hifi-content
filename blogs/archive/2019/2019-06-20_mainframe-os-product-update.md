Mainframe OS Product Update

## **New Roadmap & Communications plan**

**Mainframe OS Public Roadmap**

We’ve been heads-down #BUIDLing our flagship product, Mainframe OS, over the past 18 months and really appreciate your interest, support, and patience with us on this journey. We are proud of what we have already accomplished, most notably our first public alpha release in April. It’s far from perfect, but brick by brick, we’re creating the foundation for a new internet. Now we’re excited to share our plans for the future of Mainframe OS. So, here it is: [the latest and greatest Mainframe OS Public Roadmap.](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/roadmap)

## **Mainframe OS Community Engagement Plan**

We’re constantly re-evaluating the best ways to communicate and share our plans and progress. Anyone reading this has already invested time and energy (or even $$!) to support us along the way, which we’re so grateful for. We are trying to find the right balance between telling you about our plans and actually getting things done — a constant battle of priorities! But we know transparency is important so here’s our updated communications plan.

We commit to:

* Post product updates on a monthly basis.

* Hold regular AMA sessions with key team members.

* Publish screencast walkthroughs of our various dapps, products, and new features.

* Update the published roadmap regularly to reflect progress, learnings, dependencies, or any other relevant changes.

* Engage on business and tech issues on our Telegram and Gitter channels, respectively. We’ll use them to gather information, listen to feedback, and mobilize willing developers to help us solve the difficult problems.

## **AMA with a Twitter Supporter**

Speaking of which, one helpful Twitter follower asked some insightful questions the other day with some constructive feedback. We figured we would respond publicly here, since others might share some of the same questions and be interested in the answers.

**@cryptocreampuff: I definitely see Mainframe becoming a huge player in the cryptocurrency world in a few years.**

***MFOS:** Thanks! We do too :)*

**@cryptocreampuff: There are currently a few problems with Mainframe in general. There is a lack of communication which causes a, like you described, “toxic” community (and when there is communication, it’s not done in a good way, the video of your “secret” project was an example of that). To improve the “quality” of your community, you could host a regular AMA, once every month for example. You could start writing biweekly updates. You could share little weekly updates on Twitter. You have to keep people aware of Mainframe, and the advancements of Mainframe.**

***MFOS:** We hear you and commit to improving communication from this point forward. This time last year we did weekly roundtable calls, monthly show&tell presentations, regular blog posts on technical and product topics, and shared content and moderated conversations with the community on twitter, telegram, gitter, discourse, slack, zendesk, email, medium, and instagram. The truth is this was way too much work for our product and tech teams and was costing us on development productivity. So we scaled way back, decided to focus on getting the product out the door, and let a lot of that go. In the meantime we have continued to talk tech with developers on [Gitter](http://community.mainframe.com) and made periodic business announcements on other channels. But those clearly need to be better coordinated and backed up with substantive deliverables. We have in fact been making great progress on this monumental development undertaking, so we just need to make sure we’re communicating that better so you can all see and appreciate that too. (See detailed engagement plan above^^)*

**@cryptocreampuff: you have to show people what is going to be released in the future. Example: New Dapps on the MainframeOS. People want to know what’s going to happen in the future. You have to make people “dream” in a certain way, and you can’t do that with the current lack of communication, nor without CLEAR goals.**

***MFOS:** YES! See our newly updated [public roadmap](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/roadmap)!*

**@cryptocreampuff: The launch of Mainframe with the airdrop was the ultimate marketing stunt. You showed people your generosity by giving[ $MFT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MFT&src=ctag) away, you showed people your love for design with the “art” round of the airdrop, and you showed people your empathy with the charity round. It was perfectly organised, perhaps the best marketing I have seen since I joined crypto in May 2017.**

***MFOS:** Why, thank you! Glad you liked it!*

**@cryptocreampuff: BUT NO MARKETING FOR THE[ #mainframeOS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mainframeOS?src=hash) LAUNCH?!?!??!?? I just don’t understand. How do you want people to start using your OS, without them knowing that it exists?**

***MFOS: **You are absolutely right. We obviously know how to do big exciting marketing campaigns, but we made a strategic decision to minimize fanfare with the initial release of Mainframe OS for a couple reasons. First, we did a limited developer release so we could get some specific feedback from developers before launching it to end users. This was important and helpful and incorporated into the subsequent user release.*

*Secondly, the first user release in 2019 was in an alpha state — meaning very early and admittedly incomplete and unstable. This project is huge with so many moving parts and technical challenges like none we’ve ever faced before. It’s critical to start getting it out to the public so we can show progress, gather feedback, exercise some of our hypotheses, and provide the basis for collaboration on this open-source project. BUT marketing at the wrong time or too soon can be more hurtful than helpful. We needed enough promo to get some users onboard, but not too much to inflate expectations too soon. Did we strike that balance right? Hard to say. But what we can say is the constructive feedback we have gotten from users and developers who have downloaded and are using Mainframe OS in the past couple months has been immensely helpful and on balance positive and supportive. Don’t worry — when the time is right we’ll pull out all the stops and make sure the world knows all about Mainframe OS.*

*But… in case you missed it — to help keep the vision alive (and flex our mad video production skills), we did release a great video promoting the Mainframe OS user release — check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNIjfK8cycQ).*

**@cryptocreampuff: You could have made a similar marketing stunt, or perhaps you could have payed influencers to use the OS in their videos on YouTube for example. Is it because of a lack of funds? Is it because you are planning some marketing? Again, you have to let the community know.**

***MFOS:** It is not for lack of funds, since you asked. Low-key releases of early versions is a strategic decision. But as you can see from our [roadmap](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/roadmap) we have big plans and are working hard toward some major milestones in the next few months. So we’re getting closer to being able to promote it more widely. Working with influencers is a great idea — thank you for sharing. We will look into those options. In fact, let us know if you have any suggestions for an influencer that would like to walk through the OS live.*

**@cryptocreampuff: let’s talk about the product itself: MainframeOS. It’s a great idea, I like it. Simple, clean, efficient.**

***MFOS:** THANK YOU for trying it out and for recognizing the hard work we have put into the user experience.*

**@cryptocreampuff: However, there is one problem: There is no reason to use it. And don’t tell me it’s freedom, or privacy, because with the current version of the OS, you don’t have more privacy nor freedom when using it. So why should people complicate their lives with an OS which has very low amount of dApps on it?**

***MFOS:** You are not completely wrong here about the challenge of building the user base and catalog of compelling dapps; but neither are we facing this uphill battle of winning users and dapp developers alone. We are in it for the long game. We believe strongly in our core values of Privacy and Freedom and know that blockchain, crypto, and decentralized technologies are the way to achieve them. We have built-in privacy and security features that empower users through data ownership and transparency that other platforms do not have. We are putting a stake in the ground that Mainframe OS is the easiest and best way for users to experience and engage with the new web3 world and are committed to the path to make that a reality.*

*To grease the wheels a bit, we’ve been dogfooding and created some unstoppable dapps of our own — all currently available to download and install in Mainframe OS. We have apps that showcase some of the standout Mainframe OS capabilities (see Noted and Payments), some apps patterned after popular crypto defi protocols with our own Mainframe OS special UX treatment (see CDP Pro and Compounded), some a straight port of popular defi dapps (see Uniswap, Looper, and CDP Portal — thanks to our friends at [Nonsense Tech](https://github.com/nonsense-tech)), and some that integrate with our contacts APIs (see Lendo, Messenger, and File Sharing on the [roadmap](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/roadmap)). We expect they will attract new users and inspire developers to see what is possible with Mainframe OS.*

**@cryptocreampuff: The community doesn’t know how much people downloaded the OS, and we doesn’t know how much the OS is actually used on a daily basis. You have to let people know how much users MFT currently has, and the monthly growth.**

***MFOS:** Since our launch in mid-April, we have had more than 1200 [downloads](https://mainframeos.com/) of the Mainframe OS installer across all platforms. This does not account, however, for developer users who have built the product from our [open-source repo](https://github.com/MainframeHQ/mainframe-os) — a segment we know is quite active.*

*As for daily active users, because of the decentralized nature of Mainframe OS, we don’t actually have any usage tracking implemented yet that would give us this information. As you can imagine this is a delicate topic, especially for a product that promotes absolute privacy and data ownership. We do need to know if/how users are using the product and its various features, but need to approach the collection, sharing, and analysis of that data very carefully. It’s listed as an area for future exploration on our [roadmap](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/roadmap).*

**@cryptocreampuff: One last thing before I end this thread, when, and how will[ $MFT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MFT&src=ctag) be used on the OS? That’s the kind of thing which interests people!**

***MFOS:** Before answering this question, I do also want to address a common confusion in terminology in the previous tweet — and that is the use of the term “MFT” as opposed to “Mainframe OS”. To be clear, **Mainframe OS** is our software product that users can download and install and use, whereas **MFT** is the symbol for our ERC20 token on the Ethereum network. We commonly say that Mainframe OS is “powered by MFT”, or in other words that MFT is the “native” token of Mainframe OS.*

*We evaluate continually what it means to have a native token on a decentralized app platform and specifically what it means for MFT to power Mainframe OS. We are targeting specialized workflows that are unique value-adds to Mainframe OS and well-suited for governance by blockchain contracts with MFT integration.*

*Already available in Mainframe OS is the ability for users to initiate invitations to connect with other Mainframe OS users via smart contract with a stake of MFT. This disincentivizes spamming and gives users complete control over their social network. The next release of Mainframe OS will additionally include MFT integration for dapp discovery. Developers will be able to pay a fee via smart contract to submit their app to be included in the built-in marketplace. Users will then be able to browse the marketplace to discover apps that are Mainframe approved.*

*We are researching and exploring several other areas as described on our [roadmap](https://docs.mainframeos.com/docs/roadmap), including blockchain-based subscriptions, community-moderated marketplace with incentivization, developer business models, abstraction of gas and fees for underlying services, among others. We are focused on seamless, substantive, and intuitive MFT integration throughout the platform and the potential for MFT to empower users of Mainframe OS in their pursuits of Privacy and Freedom.*

*Again, we are not alone in the decentralized development community in continuing to explore these concepts to find the right balance. We seek out opportunities to engage with others learning and applying token economics and utility whenever possible. We welcome any informed and constructive feedback and ideas for how we can continue to support the principle that Mainframe OS is powered by MFT.*

**@cryptocreampuff: Voilà! That was it, and don’t worry, I still strongly support Mainframe! :) Thank you for taking in consideration this criticism, Max**

***MFOS:** THANK YOU, Max, for taking the time to think through the problems we are facing and present them in a constructive way, complete with transparency, genuine understanding, continued support, and proposed solutions. We really appreciate your participation in our journey!*
