# The Value of (Relevant) Notifications



**The problem of notifications today**

Email and their more contemporary cousin, Push Notifications, are one of our the greatest headaches of modern times. Something that we, in one way or the other, dread. But at the same time we need to find a way to deal with. Before trying to understand how notifications can be a source of added value, rather than a big annoyance, how did we end like this?

The reality is that, “*not all notifications are born equal.”*

Some are intended to notify a person, some to notify a whole group or even entire company. Some are just informative, whereas others might provide crucial information that is required to move a project or task forward.

Yet, most notifications today look, feel and behave pretty much the same. Not only are all coming from many, far too many, sources, most of the time endlessly duplicating our efforts to handle them. The overwhelming nature of notifications and the lack of proper control on them, has led to what can really be described as a ‘notification deluge’. And this has consequently pushed more and more people to either ignore them, or increasingly, to go for the ultimate nuclear option — mute them.

**Mute is by far (not) the best option**

But hold on a second. Ignoring or even down right muting notifications isn’t the smartest solution. In fact, it can be said to being even more disastrous. Imagine you got rid of your phone ring sound or, even more extreme, your doorbell. You would practically be isolating yourself, causing yes, the noise to be avoided, but also the key, relevant calls, or visits, to be missed.

Even more, your ‘wall’ can be easily circumvented, with a flood of texts and emails (or even people walking over to your desk!!). Replacing the ringtone or incessant knocking and shouting through doors instead of a door bell. That doesn’t just sound like a nightmare — it would be a one! The reality is that notifications, in all, just can’t be avoided. They mustn’t be fought back. Notifications are a necessary evil.

**The value of notifications for efficient workflows**

But are they really *all *that evil? Do notifications just cause headaches and make us all waste our very valuable time? Can they be good?

Stepping away a second from our potentially too rushed judgement, we must admit that being notified at the right time, for the right thing, can make life much easier. An email notifies my Amazon package is delivered? Great, I can now replace my broken door knob. A push notifications tells me there’s a customer support request? Great, I can help a loyal customer being happier with my product. The final edits on a shared document contract is completed? Great, I can now finally send it out to close the deal.

Undoubtedly, all the prompt reactions above were allowed by timely and relevant notifications. Without them, communication breakages, bottlenecks and infinite follow ups would become the ordinary. In fact, we need to realize that in our increasingly interdependent workplaces, if communication isn’t efficient and breaks down, the entire machine is affected.

Notifications, in fact, could be seen as the critical glue of our workflows and processes. But are they perfect? By far from it. Can they be improved? For sure. Does something better exist? Well, maybe… ;)
