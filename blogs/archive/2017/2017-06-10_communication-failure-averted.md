# Communication Failure Averted.



Imagine you’re walking along the road — normal chores and errands. Maybe picking up groceries. Then, suddenly, you hear prop planes overhead. Not just one or two. Dozens. The sky darkens as stacks of paper are dropped, filling the streets in front of you. Though fearful, you pick up a single sheet. It looks to be the work of an enemy country. The willful reading of propaganda is an illegal act where you live, but your curiosity gets the best of you. You discover the document details a complete and unconditional surrender of your homeland to a foreign combatant.

On July 26th, 1945, United States planes did just that. They flew over Japan territory and transmitted radio broadcasts to the effect of demanding an unconditional surrender, with dire consequences if declined.

The Japanese government debated this declaration within itself. Did the threat have merit? How would their discussions with the Russians be altered by this? Some generals were absolutely against it, stating the disarmament clauses and various criminal ramifications were “too dishonorable”.

The then prime minister of Japan, Kantaro Suzuki, held a press conference and stated that the Japanese cabinet’s attitude towards the declaration of surrender was one of “mokusatsu”.

Mokusatsu.

In kanji, (Japanese writing using Chinese characters) the words “silence” and “kill” are used to depict mokusatsu. Meaning, as you might guess, kill with silence. This was interpreted as a severely disrespectful act by the United States, and shortly after this press conference the United States unleashed the horrors of the nuclear bomb.

Only, there’s a problem.

Words are tricky things. Mokusatsu, despite the kanji pairing of kill and silence, doesn’t necessarily mean the great amount of disrespect we might think. It could also be interpreted as “to ignore for now”, or, in more contemporary terms, “no comment.”

The Prime Minister Suzuki had meant to say “no comment.” It was still an internal debate.

Many linguists consider this situation one of the most tragic and deadly historical instances that could have been averted with a better choice of words, better communication, and better specificity.

Now, most of us don’t have to work with such high stakes. But, none-the-less, communication errors are a big hindrance in daily progress. Assignments can get lost. Responsibilities can be non-specific. Projects fall behind deadline.
