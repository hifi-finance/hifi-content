# The Workplace: 1997 vs. 2017



Ah yes, 1997, what a year. Our imaginations took us to Hogwarts for the first time. Spice Girls dominated the airwaves and Leomania swept the nation, after* Titanic* smashed pretty much every global box office record. What a time to be alive, right?

A lot has changed in 20 years: Harry Potter is now casting spells in the West End, Spice Girls are long gone, and DiCaprio has finally won an Oscar. It’s the workplace; however, that has arguably seen the biggest changes. If you plucked an employee from 1997 and transported them to 2017, they would be blown away by the advances we’ve made. So, let’s have a look at some of them now!

**Communication**

In the modern-day state of 24/7 communication, 1997 seems like the Stone Age. There once was a time when you had to make the choice between using the computer *or* calling on a landline, imagine?!

The internet was far slower and less reliable than today, making work communication via email sluggish and frustrating. Don’t even get me started on mobile phones either, back when antennas were still needed and finding a signal was like panning for gold.

Not only can we now make calls and use the internet at the same time, we can also communicate with peers anytime with smartphones. This has been made possible with the advancement of a wide variety of messaging apps.

One of the newest and most exciting of these apps is [*Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/)*. Built for both mobile and desktop, it allows you to have real-time communication. Get your team on [*Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/download/)* today!

**Productivity**

Due to the slow nature of communication back in ’97, work productivity was nowhere near the light-speed pace it is today. For plan to be implemented successfully in the workplace, there needed to be a constant physical supervisory presence and employees working in close quarters.

In today’s workplace, however, productivity can be sky high even when staff are on different continents. This has been afforded by both the wider channels of communication and the advancement in technology.

[*Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/)* allows employees to send messages that make a difference. Add context through an “Action,” which highlights areas of the message that needs to be focused on. Ensuring effortlessly streamlined channels of communication and increased levels of productivity across the workplace!

**Freedom from the Office**

The 90’s saw huge technical improvements; the launching of the internet, Google, the iMac — employees back in 1997 would have killed for what we have now.

One thing we take for granted in today’s workplace is the ability to work from wherever we please. Remote working has become a staple in the 21st century, much to the pleasure of those who were waking up at stupid-o’clock every morning to take the long squished commute to the office.

Much like the improvement of productivity, being able to work outside the office has taken place, thanks to a wealth of technological advancements.

Once again we find ourselves talking about [*Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/download/). *Sending a message with an “action item”, “Hi, Pete. Hope you are well. **Can you update the June spreadsheet by this afternoon, please?” **The part selected as an “action item” will appear in Pete’s To-Do List. Once he’s updated the June spreadsheet, he can tick it off his list! Then whomever sent the request will see that Pete is a damn superstar and everyone is happy!

**The Cloud**

Ever since its inception, the cloud has completely changed both our business and personal lives. Despite a rocky start, when no one seemed to know what on Earth this ‘cloud’ was, it is not part and parcel of our daily routine.

How different it was in 1997! Sure you could save files on computers and floppy discs, but if they were damaged or lost — you were screwed. The agony of losing hours of work when your Windows 95 desktop would decide at a moments notice to crash was excruciating, to say the least.

Where would we be without our new technology, eh? Along with now saving work to the cloud we can also store all our online conversations, too. Thanks to apps like [*Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/download/).*

Wherever you go, [*Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/download/) *allows you to always have a record of your work conversations. Making the workplace a far more transparent place, ensuring nothing is lost in translation!
