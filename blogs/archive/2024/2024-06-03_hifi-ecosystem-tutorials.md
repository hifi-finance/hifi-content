Hifi Ecosystem Tutorials

At Hifi, we understand that navigating the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) can be confusing, especially with frequent updates and improvements being released. That’s why we’re excited to announce our new tutorial videos on YouTube, designed to simplify and guide you through our ecosystem.

### What are on the Videos?

Our short and easy-to-follow videos cover a wide range of topics, each focusing on a different aspect of the Hifi lending protocol or Hifi token. check out the videos below:

1. **Token Swap Tutorial**

Back in 2021, Mainframe rebranded to Hifi, and as part of that, we went through a token swap and redenomination of our token. Learn how to securely swap your old MFT tokens to the new HIFI tokens.

2. **Governance Tutorial**

With the token swap, the Hifi DAO was born, giving HIFI token holders control of all material aspects of the protocol via governance voting. Learn how to delegate your tokens and participate in voting to improve the Hifi protocol.

3. **Borrowing Tutorial**

Hifi allows you to borrow at a fixed rate for a fixed term, determined by our built-in [automated market](https://docs.hifi.finance/protocol/technical-reference/market-making/hifi-pool). The more you borrow, the higher your interest rate may be.

4. **Lending Tutorial**

When you lend in Hifi, you are buying future cash payments at a discount. These future cash payments are represented by tokens that we call “hTokens”. An hToken is a token that can be redeemed one-for-one for an underlying asset on some future date.

5. **Adding Liquidity**

Being a liquidity provider gives you a portion of the fees paid on every single trade that occurs in this particular market. Adding liquidity to the Hifi markets is a great way to put your idle capital to work since the risk of impermanent loss is low.
