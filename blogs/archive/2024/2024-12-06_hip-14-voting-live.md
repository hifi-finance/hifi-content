HIP 14 Voting Live!

Governance voting on [Hifi Improvement Proposal 14](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/13) is live on Tally and aims to continue Hifiâ€™s successful Liquidity Bootstrapping Program by authorizing the redeployment of any HIFI tokens that may be returned to the DAO through [HIP 6](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/5) refunds. The original program has secured over $13.5M in protocol liquidity, and this proposal ensures we can maintain this momentum by reusing returned tokens for the same purpose with the same terms as HIP 6.

## Vote Timeline

The voting window will be open for 5 days. If the voting threshold is met and the proposal passes, the process to implement the changes will begin. If the vote does not pass, no changes will be made and future drafts of the proposal may be considered if necessary.
