## Vote Timeline

The voting window will be open for 5 days. If the voting threshold is met and the proposal passes, the process to implement the changes will begin. If the vote does not pass, no changes will be made and future drafts of the proposal may be considered if necessary.

These real-world asset collateral types will help us hit our 2024 goal of $25M in TVL on the protocol! Be a part of our growing community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uGxaCppKSH) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hififinance).
