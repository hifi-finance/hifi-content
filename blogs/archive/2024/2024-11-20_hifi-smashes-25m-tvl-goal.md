Hifi Smashes $25M TVL Goal!

We’re absolutely thrilled to announce that Hifi has not just reached but **CRUSHED** our ambitious **$25M Total Value Locked goal**! Last year, we laid out this target in our [2024 roadmap](https://blog.hifi.finance/hifi-2024-roadmap-e489383df572); some thought it was too ambitious. Today, the Hifi protocol has reached over $25M TVL. This rapid TVL growth is really pushing this version of our protocol to the limits; we have over $9M of hUSDC sitting on the sidelines, not counting toward the TVL metric. If we calculated TVL for each dollar of debt the protocol funds, our TVL would be at a whopping **$34.99M!**

*For more information on how TVL is tracked and counted, check out [Doug’s writeup](https://discord.com/channels/724701556087455815/1117890331032162505/1316556400121348187) in the [Hifi Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uGxaCppKSH).*

## A Community Achievement

This milestone belongs to every single person who believed in Hifi’s vision of bringing **real-world assets** (RWAs) on-chain: **Our DAO Members** who thoughtfully shaped and voted on Hifi Improvement Proposals (HIPs), O**ur Liquidity Providers** who backed us with unwavering support, **Our Borrowers** who trusted us with their assets, O**ur Developers** who built our robust infrastructure, **Our Guardians **who safeguarded our community, and **Every Community Member** who spread the word — this is your victory!

## Our Journey Together

What makes this achievement even more special is how we got here. Our community’s first major victory was [**HIP 6 — the Liquidity Bootstrapping Program](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/5)**. This program marked a strategic shift in Hifi’s liquidity approach, targeting a more robust and long-lasting growth model and presenting several key benefits to the Hifi ecosystem and its stakeholders such as enhanced growth and scalability, a sustainable liquidity model, and a more strategic utilization of resources.

**Hifi Improvement Proposal 6** turned our biggest challenge — liquidity — into our greatest strength!

From there, we systematically expanded our RWA offerings through a series of groundbreaking HIPs:

* [**HIP 7](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/6):** Established our residential construction framework with clear builder qualification criteria

* [**HIP 8](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/7):** introduced our first commercial real estate framework, opening doors to multi-unit developments and office spaces

* [**HIP 9](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/8):** revolutionized medical equipment financing with the $MEC1 token implementation

* [**HIPs 10–13](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposals):** have further refined these frameworks while expanding market access

Our community didn’t just participate — you led the way, your voices in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uGxaCppKSH), your votes on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao), and your discussions in our [forums](https://forum.hifi.finance/) — these were the building blocks of our success.

## Celebrating Today, Building Tomorrow

While reaching **$25M+ TVL** is incredible, we’re just getting started with our RWA strategy. Our successful frameworks and growing expertise in bringing real-world assets on-chain have created a strong foundation for even greater growth. We’re already working on new innovative collateral types and enhanced protocol efficiency to support our expanding RWA ecosystem.
