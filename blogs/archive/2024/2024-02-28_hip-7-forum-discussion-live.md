HIP 7 Forum Discussion Live

We proudly announce that the [discussion forum](https://forum.hifi.finance/t/hip-7-commercial-real-estate-cre1p-as-collateral/315) for Hifi Improvement Proposal 7 is now live! This proposal introduces our first commercial real estate collateral to be voted on to add to the Hifi Lending protocol. We encourage all DAO members to review and discuss the proposal before voting goes live 48 hours from now. Voting will take place on [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/6?chart=0).

To prepare for this upcoming HIP vote DAO members should ensure their tokens are taken off of exchanges and are held in a self-custody wallet like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/registry/wallets). Also, take a moment to review your [delegation status](https://www.tally.xyz/user/connect?wallet&redirect=/gov/hifi-dao/my-voting-power) to ensure your governance participation.

As a reminder, the voting snapshot will be taken in 48 hours. From there HIP 7 voting will be live for 5 days. If the proposal passes the new collateral will be added to the lending protocol after a 2-day timelock.

For those participating in the [Hifi Ecosystem Zealy quests](https://zealy.io/c/hififinance) keep an eye out for governance-specific quests to boost your chances of winning the upcoming giveaway.

Weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and opinions on the latest proposal. Our team is active on both [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hififinance) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uGxaCppKSH). See you there!
