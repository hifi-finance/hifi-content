HIP 10: Administrative Appointment

It’s time to take care of some housekeeping with an important administrative item before the DAO can file our first tax return. Given that Hifi DAO is a US entity and is subject to US tax law, we need to appoint a DAO manager.

### DAO Managers

As a refresher on what a DAO Manager is, you can reference [Section 3.2](https://github.com/hifi-finance/legal-docs/blob/main/Formation%20Docs/HIFI%20DAO%20TUNAA.pdf) of Hifi DAO’s Association Agreement. Basically, DAO Managers receive authority through a vote of the DAO to perform actions that cannot be performed on the blockchain.

This scope of authority includes legal representation, financial activities, contractual agreements, and administrative duties. Be sure to check out the [full document](https://github.com/hifi-finance/legal-docs/blob/main/HIP10/Resolution%20to%20Appoint%20DAO%20Manager.pdf) for a comprehensive understanding of the DAO Manager Role.

### Vote for Doug

HIP 10 will seek approval to appoint Doug Leonard as DAO Manager. Practically speaking, This changes nothing in how we have been and will continue to operate. It simply gives us a formal way to stay compliant.

### Next Steps

HIP 10 will go live alongside [HIP 9](https://blog.hifi.finance/collateral-ruleset-medical-equipment-1cf3d1c404e7), which is seeking governance approval to add a Medical Equipment Collateral Ruleset. Both proposals are expected to go live on the [forum](https://forum.hifi.finance/) in the coming days.

For all things Hifi keep an eye on our announcements, participate in our discussions, and be a part of the community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uGxaCppKSH) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hififinance).
