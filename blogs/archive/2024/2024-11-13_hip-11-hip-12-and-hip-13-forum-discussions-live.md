HIP 11, HIP 12, and HIP 13 Forum Discussions Live

The discussion forums for three new Hifi Improvement Proposals are live! These proposals aim to amend a current ruleset while introducing two new rulesets that expand upon existing collateral types. We encourage all DAO members to review and weigh in on the proposals before they move to a vote. The proposals will go live on [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposals) November 15th, 2024, and be open for voting 48 hours after.

### Hifi Improvement Proposal 11:

This proposal aims to make amendments to our Residential Construction Ruleset. These amendments will make the protocol more accessible while maintaining strong risk controls by introducing broader market access, flexible guarantees, and a clearer disbursement structure.

### Hifi Improvement Proposal 12:

This improvement proposal aims to establish a ruleset for onboarding vintage vehicles as collateral in the Hifi Protocol. This proposal updates and expands upon the framework established in [HIP 3](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/hifi-dao/proposal/1), moving from single-vehicle approval to a broader category-based approach for vintage vehicles.

### Hifi Improvement Proposal 13:

This proposal aims to add a ruleset for Commercial Real Estate. We’ve already successfully added commercial real estate to the protocol; now it’s time to adopt a generalized collateral ruleset to enable many more. This ruleset defines the framework for onboarding Commercial Real Estate ($CRE2) as collateral within the Hifi Protocol For more details and to join the discussion, visit the [HIP 13 Forum Discussion](https://forum.hifi.finance/t/hip-13-commercial-real-estate-collateral-ruleset/423).
