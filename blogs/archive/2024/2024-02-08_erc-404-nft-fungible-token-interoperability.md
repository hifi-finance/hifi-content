“ERC-404” NFT & Fungible Token Interoperability

[Unisocks](https://socks.uniswap.org/) is the granddaddy of interoperability between the two most popular token standards, ERC-20 and ERC-721. Buy the fungible token on Uniswap and then later redeem it for an NFT and a physical pair of socks.

### What’s ERC-404?

As explained by [@BinanceResearch](https://twitter.com/BinanceResearch/status/1755677020120367155). Self-proclaimed ERC-404 is an unofficial, experimental, and unaudited token “standard” that aims to combine properties of fungible and non-fungible (NFT) tokens into a unified interface.

Several tradeoffs were made to try and get these two distinct paradigms to cooperate inside a single interface. NFT liquidity and fractionalization are the desired benefits 404 tries to capture.

Give it a read and you can get a sense of the tradeoffs necessary to bring this idea to life. Below are some of the reactions.

Good news for those looking for the tools to fractionalize and liquify NFT collections. Pooled NFT is an out-of-the-box solution that provides just this! As the name implies, Pooled NFT allows anyone to deploy an NFT Pool and corresponding ERC-20 token. Pool Tokens are always backed one-to-one by the NFTs in the pool.

Rather than trying to push all the functionality into a single token standard, our team created a set of smart contracts that keep the standards separate, yet allow for interoperability. This approach reduces complexity and makes for a much safer implementation. Check out our app at [PooledNFT.com](http://PooledNFT.com) or dive into our [docs](https://hifi-finance.gitbook.io/pooled-nft/) to learn more.

If you want to see all of what’s possible check out [Sheet Heads](https://sheetheads.com/), an NFT collection that utilizes Pooled NFT and already has liquidity in Uniswap Markets. Buy a Sheet Head on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/sheet-heads) or buy a fraction of a Sheet Head on [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xc2bc2320D22D47D1e197E99D4a5dD3261ccf4A68), the choice is yours!
