## HIP 2 Overview

* **Hifi Protocol Deployment to Ethereum:** The Hifi Protocol is ready for Mainnet. After several iterations and audits, the Hifi Protocol stood the test of time on Polygon. A new version of the Hifi protocol will be deployed on Ethereum. The new market will begin on Ethereum in January 2023 just after the last market, currently live on Polygon, expires.

* **Hifi DAO:** Create a new legal entity, Hifi DAO, and empower HIFI token holders with ownership, control, and the ability to deploy resources. Once deployed, HIFI token holders will control all aspects of these smart contracts. No one, including Hifi Labs, will have the ability to modify the contracts without Hifi DAO Governance approval.

* **Ownership:** Hifi Labs will transfer ownership of all Hifi-related social, web, and intellectual properties, along with any associated accounts to the newly created Hifi DAO legal entity. Hifi Labs will enter into a two year contract with Hifi DAO with the specific focus of ensuring a smooth transition of responsibility to Hifi DAO and fueling growth of the Hifi protocol.

* **HIFI Token Swap:** MFT will be swapped for HIFI at a rate of 100 MFT to 1 HIFI. 100M HIFI Tokens will be redeemed by MFT token holders. As previously announced, 1.25M HIFI tokens will be airdropped to MFT holders who have participated in Governance votes, inclusive of this proposal. 25M HIFI tokens will be allocated to Hifi Labs, vesting linearly over 2 years. The total supply of HIFI will be 126.25M Tokens.

### Step 2. Cast your vote

Before voting, make sure to read the proposal and to read the linked topic on the Hifi forum. Given Hifi’s governance system is a democracy, the quality of the decision-making depends entirely on the quality of the thought process backing the votes of MFT token-holders.
