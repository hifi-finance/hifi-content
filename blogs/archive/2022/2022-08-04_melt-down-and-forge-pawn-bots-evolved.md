Melt Down and Forge: Pawn Bots Evolved

### Upgrading bot rarity, fine-tuning aesthetic, and entering for a chance of winning a new 1-of-1 Pawn Bot is live.

**Sacrifice & Burn?**

Melt Down and Forge is a 20-day event where holders can choose to burn & sacrifice their Pawn Bots to generate new versions.

The original Pawn Bots supply was 8,888. During Melt Down and Forge, holders bring forth two bots, mix and match from the pool of available traits, and send one bot to the ETH burn address. This community-executed burn is causing the supply to decrease daily.

Beyond the project reveal, we learned how important aesthetics and rarity are to holders. Pawn Bots has opened this mechanism to allow for upgrades while decreasing supply.

**A New 1-of-1 Pawn Bot**

Every time holders sacrifice a bot to the burn address they will be credited with an entry for the ultra-rare 1-of-1 Pawn Bot. And that’s it…

**Forge instructions:**

You won’t have insights into what traits others are choosing or what is left until the reveal. Sending a bot to the burn address destroys the traits it possesses. If too many common traits are removed from the remaining supply, what’s common today may be tomorrow’s rarest attribute.

Pawn Bot upgrades are made possible by metadata refreshes made directly to the contract. In order to help more holders realize the advantages of this event, we have launched instructions and details at [https://www.pawnbots.com/melt-down-and-forge](https://www.pawnbots.com/melt-down-and-forge)
