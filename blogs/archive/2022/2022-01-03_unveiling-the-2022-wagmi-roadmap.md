Unveiling the 2022 WAGMI Roadmap

### New goals, continued focus and a ton to unpack: the future is bright.
> For the illiterate: “WAGMI” stands for “we are gonna make it”.

If you haven’t done so already, check out our recent post where we discuss our [strategy to drive adoption of Hifi’s lending protocol](https://blog.hifi.finance/strategy-the-road-ahead-3b6c1598b364). There we discuss our bold new strategy as we venture into the world of NFTs and build at the intersection of DeFi and the Metaverse!

### An expanding identity

While there is overlap in audience between DeFi and the NFT space, for the most part, these audiences are quite separate. Today, our community is very much a DeFi community, but that identity is about to expand.

Ours is the opportunity to financialize an entire segment of the crypto industry. It won’t happen overnight and it won’t happen as we are today. We’ve got some serious growth and education ahead of us. For many, the world of NFTs is new and unfamiliar. Those that are new to the world of NFTs won’t become experts overnight, but if we can jump in with two feet we can start learning immediately. It’s not enough if just a few of us can bridge the divide, we must go together.

### Together, not alone

Our roadmap sets out the milestones necessary to onboard anyone into the space, regardless of their experience with NFTs. One of the best ways we can learn is by doing. Appropriately, to help both our team and the community get their feet wet with NFTs we will launch collections of our own. They will be built to act as durable collateral for our lending protocol to leverage. The infrastructure will be extensible and we anticipate being able to unlock lending markets against all of your favorite bluechip NFT collections!

So in addition to governance and lending protocol updates, we expect Q1 to deliver an NFT collection, and the early prototypes for the infrastructure necessary to support a decentralized NFT debt marketplace. These new NFT and infrastructure products will go live with a dedicated brand, purpose-built to drive adoption of the Hifi lending protocol.
