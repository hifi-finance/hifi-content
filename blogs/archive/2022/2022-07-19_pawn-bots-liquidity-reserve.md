> Note: For the purpose of this article I will be using “NFTs” to reference Pawn Bots and “bots” to reference code used to automate certain tasks.

Since our mint (on July 7th) we’ve received questions about team wallets holding a good number of Pawn Bots. We want to start off by saying **none of these will be sold for the benefit of individual team members** or given away to influencers. All of these bots will be used in support of borrowing within the collection.

**Where can I find the Liquidity Reserve wallets?**

If you happen to take a look at [top token holders on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x28f0521c77923f107e29a5502a5a1152517f9000#balances) for Pawn Bots, you’ll notice the top two (ignoring null address) are the following accounts:

liquidity.reserve.1.pawnbots.eth — 1000

liquidity.reserve.2.pawnbots.eth — 980

These two wallets belong to the team and these NFTs were withheld during the mint to support borrowing within the collection (more on that later).

**What is the purpose of each wallet?**

Both will be used for liquidity. 1000 will be used in the process of setting up a price oracle for the collection to determine a fair market value for the floor price. The other 980 will be sold on a curve up to 1 ETH to collect funds, which will, in turn, be used to lend back to borrowers through the protocol (once the collection floor price has sustained a 1 ETH price).

**How will NFTs be listed?**

Hifi will list NFTs evenly across a specified price curve up to 1 ETH. The selling price will always be above the floor so as to not push the floor price down. The proceeds will be used for liquidity to lend back to holders.

**How many bots will be sold?**

We expect to sell 980 or just over 10% of the collection.

**Stopping the mint early**

We also want to use this opportunity to clear the air about why we stopped the mint with about 2,600 bots remaining. We did this in order to stop a few wallets using bots to acquire more than we were comfortable with, given the mint limit was 2 NFTs per wallet. We decided to list the remaining NFTs on OpenSea ([see wallet Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b292c3e84ae171f25dc6723af6f47a723bcee03)) over the following days at a price similar to what it would have cost for gas fees involved in minting. This was done in an effort to enforce more fair distribution of NFTs and discourage consolidation within a few large wallets. Holders using bots to acquire large numbers of NFTs can be harmful to the long-term outlook of a project.

We hope this helps provide some clarity as we look forward to more of the roadmap opening up over time. In the meantime head on over to [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/pawnbots) to get your Pawn Bots and be sure to take part in the [reveal](https://itsalmo.st/pawn-bots-reveal-time-26gz)!
