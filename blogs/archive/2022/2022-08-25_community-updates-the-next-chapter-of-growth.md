# Community Updates: The Next Chapter of Growth

Managing a growing community of crypto enthusiasts is not an easy undertaking. And over the years we have been through a lot, and have done an exceptional job at making our community a place where everyone could voice most anything they want. Itâ€™s now time to revisit the community policies that make us who we are and incorporate some learning from years of running multiple crypto communities.

Going forward you can expect a much more focused dialogue in our discord. We are going to be more opinionated on enforcing appropriate dialogue and provide guidelines to help those genuinely trying to help, express themselves effectively and guard ourselves against unproductive and antagonistic dialogue.

Our discord is where we meet to build and coordinate. You can use the following guidelines to help in your contributions to self-evaluate and if you are a moderator to guide your decision-making in moderating the community.

Criticism is always welcome, how it is presented matters. When presenting criticism, ensure you have put in the effort to first understand the topic at hand and understand if there is expected to be new information shared within a short time period about the topic. Criticism coupled with recommendations is best.

Ask yourself if you are contributing energy or sucking it out of the community. Spirited debate and differing opinions are most effective when they add energy to the community. If you are not adding energy to the community you are sucking it out. Watch the effect your contributions have, read others' responses, and measure your impact.

## Appropriate Consequences

We will introduce a Quarantine channel and role which will appropriately quarantine individuals that consistently suck energy from our community. The Quarantine role will limit individuals to the Quarantine channel to express themselves. They can still read all regularly available channels but will not be able to engage directly in those channels. This will give the community the option to engage on their terms for anyone in Quarantine. The role will be assigned for a specified period of time that escalates for repeat offenders. Beginning with 1 Day, and increasing to 1 week, 1 month, and finally 1 year.

We feel this is an excellent alternative to banning people from the community outright and allows members a chance to correct behavior.

Onwards!
