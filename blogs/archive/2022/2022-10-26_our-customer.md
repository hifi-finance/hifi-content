Our Customer

In our previous [blog post](https://blog.hifi.finance/the-road-to-token-swap-89b0c2c739f3), we outlined the following criteria for our collective success as a community:
> As we look to the future it’s essential that we position ourselves as a value add layer to the customers that the Hifi Lending Protocol will serve. It’s paramount that we are able to clearly articulate who that customer is so our efforts can be laser focused on solving their problems.
> Our opportunity is a function of the size our customer segment represents, and the severity of the problem our offering solves.

In this blog post, we identify exactly who our customer is and introduce their biggest problem. Our next post will break down the specifics that make up the key issues of their challenge.

### NFTs Onboard Users to Blockchain

NFTs are responsible for onboarding the most non-crypto users than any other segment of our industry. Most prominently, we recently saw Reddit launch blockchain-backed collectible avatars. Their strategy included avoiding niche terms like “NFT” and avoiding using the blockchain for payments when onboarding users. The results? Reddit now has more active blockchain wallets than Opensea and their on-chain volume has been phenomenal.

### The Future of NFTs

Today, most NFTs represent digital collectibles. Looking ahead into the future, we can see NFTs being used to tokenize ownership of Real World Assets (RWAs) including art, real estate, and other luxury goods.

It’s still early for RWAs, but many are experimenting with the proper legal structures to tokenize RWAs. In time, common patterns will emerge that will effectively serve consumer needs. RWAs tokenized as NFTs represent the greatest onboarding of value blockchain technology will ever see.

## Our Customer: NFT Communities

NFTs are both the ***user onramp** *for blockchain and positioned to be the ***value onramp*** via Real World Assets (RWAs). This is why we will position Hifi and our Ecosystem to serve NFT Communities as our customers.

### Customer Success

Success for NFT projects, be it digital collections or tokenized Real World Assets, can be distilled down to a project’s ability to grow and retain community members. **Growth and retention** is the largest problem NFT projects face. Without it, projects cease to exist, it is a matter of life and death for NFT communities. This is an extremely important problem to solve for creators, issuers, communities, and holders alike.

We know firsthand the challenges NFT communities face and are uniquely positioned to leverage our experience and expertise in DeFi to solve their challenges. Hifi and our Ecosystem enable NFT communities to maximize their growth and retention. To understand how we need to deconstruct the major barriers NFT communities face and understand what new offerings are coming to the Hifi ecosystem.
