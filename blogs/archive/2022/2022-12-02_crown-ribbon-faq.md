Crown Ribbon FAQ

### A quick recap of some of the community questions from [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mhtSRz6) we’ve answered regarding our Crown Ribbon partnership announcement.

### **Questions:**

How can we see what bloodline Crown Ribbon have in their stock? How many horses, who owns them, trains them, and where they are run?

I am curious what Crown Ribbon has for market cap now and then how much they anticipate to be able to scale w/ this novel fractionalized blockchain approach. Like how much of the $300 billion market do they presently have? Will we be limiting the partnership to this entity, or do we think it’s going to spark interest from others that will want to do their own?

### Answer:

Such great questions! We will need to do a whole write-up on the vision for [Crown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/). But in short, Crown Ribbon will not own any horses. It’s intended to be the platform for onboarding and managing SEC compliance, syndicate audits, and the physical custody of the ownership papers for the horses. The hope is to onboard many syndicates in time.

### Comment:

The idea of fractional ownership is pretty awesome.

### Answer:

The best part is that fractional ownership of horses is not a new concept for the industry. It’s a pretty incredible match for our tech.

### Question:

If a horse dies, we could lose all the money we invested in that horse. right? In particular, horses are more likely to be euthanized if they suffer a fracture.

### Answer:

The most valuable horses actually carry life insurance policies that help hedge against this type of circumstance. Additionally, working with full syndicates helps de-risk this across the entire holdings. Finally, there are some really interesting economic properties that exist when you look at what happens to the value of the stored (frozen) reproductive outputs of a recently deceased horse. Asserting your horse was a real winner and was cash flowing from reproductive income, then you suddenly have a supply shock and it stands to reason that asserting constant demand and decreasing supply that the value of the stored reproductive outputs may also help hedge the losses of an asset at the conclusion of its lifecycle.

### Question:

I am interested to see how and at what pace this starts to onboard that segment of the horse racing industry in the U.S. Are there plans in place to expand to other jurisdictions (if so where?)-legal compliance issues would need to be worked through.

### Answer:

The plan is to disrupt the entire industry. We need a starting point and we need to take it one step at a time. But that’s the plan.

### Question:

So, I understand that, relative to the fractional ownership. So how would it apply when a token is established and collateralized? people would be able to borrow against their fractionalized ownership?

### Answer:

That’s the hope, so long as HifiDAO throws its support behind it.

### Question:

If we choose one market partnership, are we going to limit certain categorical applicants that are just copycats, or do we want to leverage that?

### Answer:

I believe context matters. I believe what we are interested in here is 1) participating in the bleeding edge of the largest onboarding of value that blockchain will ever see. 2) directly driving value into Hifi’s TVL 3) demonstrating real business cases for blockchain 4) leveraging blockchain to actually disrupt an industry.

Of all those priorities, we likely care about #2 the most. So I anticipate we’d get aligned around that objective. Before we start trying to police loyalty to anyone or anything. If it’s sound collateral with excellent recourse or liquidity. Then I’d want it onboarded into HifiDAO.

But that’s just me, and I’d have to climb down off my high horse before I’d want to let a copycat come aboard.

So step one, Doug gets off his high horse, step two, onboard them.

### Question:

What are the criteria for establishing partnerships? I want to build partnerships and build TVL.

### Answer:

Step 1) become a DAO, Step 2) Establish criteria for partnerships.

### Comment:

Will be so interesting to learn about the methodology of bringing an RWA to market.

### Answer:

It’s the bleeding edge, with lots to learn for all stakeholders involved.

### Question:

I don’t know much about the horse industry but I’ve heard about Many law cases where horses were sold and not in the state the owner claimed it to be.

Next problem: why would a horse owner always tell you when he sells semen or something? He can just do it and never tell the token owner?

### Answer:

Can’t sell a horse without its papers. Can’t race a horse without its papers either. Crown Ribbon will custody the ownership papers, and be responsible for auditing syndicates it onboards.

It’s not the horse owner that is doing all this. Typically when you’re standing a stud, the stud is located at a specialized facility whose business is to help the stud do his business. Outputs are reasonably predictable and like any job, there are systems of accountability in place. The industry has worked really well up to this point and I don’t expect what we’re doing increases the probability of fraud taking place.

### Question:

Will Crown Ribbon be using some type of escrow?

### Answer:

They are the escrow in a sense. They are the custodian of the horse ownership papers.

### Question:

Is C[rown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/), like [Pawn Bots](https://www.pawnbots.com/) (sort of), in that is it owned (or partially owned) by hifi labs or hifi dao? I just ask, because I look at Twitter and it seems pretty new and when I click on Chad Beus website, It seems like he uses another website.

### Answer:

Yeah, the relationship is Chad and Hifi Labs are founding partners, and we’ll be working to onboard assets to be consumed by Hifi DAO (subject to approval of the DAO.) His website and such is to help showcase his credibility. He’s co-founder of one of the largest barrel racing circuits in the world. They pay out more winnings to riders than any other barrel racing event in the world.

### Question:

Does [Crown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/)/Chad have syndicates/horses ready to onboard once the protocol is up & approved collateral occurs?

### Answer:

We’ve got the first syndicate mostly finalized. SEC is gonna be the main bottleneck on this in terms of time.

### Question:

Will these be public offerings for purchase once finalized or is the purchase etc all completed pending final SEC approval?

### Answer:

Once finalized.

### Question:

So you own a share of a racehorse. There are ongoing costs involved, stabling, feed, training, Vet bills, etc. If you get a nag who never wins it could be expensive — are you required to continually deposit funds for upkeep? Do you unload the horse to someone else willing to buy or could the partnership becomes untenable (financially) and is dissolved by all shareowners? Or have I got it wrong?

### Answer:

Really great question! My ideal customer experience is that additional funds are never necessary. That means that syndicates that are already cash flow positive are a better fit to satisfy this criteria. Meaning that the syndicate is earning enough to cover the standard operating costs and maintains a cash reserve. Anything above these expenses is then passed on to owners as a dividend just like you might see in a regular business operation.

However, let’s indulge in the reality that still this scenario of expenses out sizing revenue of a syndicate. A well-designed system needs to account for this exact scenario. Given that I do not know exactly what end users will prefer I’ll share the options we have available to us. Option 1) as you described, we could ask existing holders to deposit their pro-rata portion of the necessary funds by a certain deadline. If you miss the deadline, new shares would be issued and liquidated using some standardized option until the deficit is made up. Option 2) Don’t worry about trying to contact existing owners and serving them a deadline, instead just post notice of the upcoming auction of new shares and let everyone participate in the open market through some standardized process. Either way, it may be necessary, and some sort of process must be in place to handle it and owners will need to be educated on what that process is to properly set expectations.

Oh and I forgot to mention that the sales price will include enough proceeds to cover costs for a specified period of time. Because much of these costs are known, they can be planned for and anticipated from the beginning and worked into the model.

### Question:

Really curious how this gonna work out with SEC and them accepting it. Probably gonna take 6 months easily, I guess.

### Answer:

Yes, part of the cost of doing business in this way.
