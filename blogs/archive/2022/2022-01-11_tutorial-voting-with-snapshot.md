Tutorial: Voting With Snapshot

### Learn How to Get Involved in Hifi governance.

We will initially rely on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hifi-finance.eth) to handle the decision-making until the token-swap. [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hifi-finance.eth) is the platform which will be used to vote on the governance proposals. It’s quickly becoming the standard for off-chain voting with [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org),[ ENS](https://ens.domains) and[ Aave](https://aave.com) using it.

Voting on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hifi-finance.eth) does **not** require transactions and there are **no** fees involved. Your MFT stays at all times within your wallet, as voting simply requires signing a message with your wallet.

### Requirements:

1. [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet or[ Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/registry/wallets)

1. [MFT](https://uniswap.exchange/swap?outputCurrency=0xdf2c7238198ad8b389666574f2d8bc411a4b7428) tokens

## Step-by-step Instructions for Snapshot

To begin, you will need MFT in your wallet. There are no gas fees involved as we will simply be signing a message.

### Step 1. Go to[ https://snapshot.org/#/hifi-finance.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/hifi-finance.eth)

Once you are on the Snapshot website, connect your wallet by clicking on “Connect to a Wallet” in the top right corner.

Confirm this interaction in your wallet.

### Step 2. Select a proposal in the proposals feed

Select the proposal you would like to vote on. Proposals can be either active, or closed. When closed, it’s not possible to vote anymore.

### Step 3. Cast your vote

Before voting, make sure to read the proposal and to read the linked topic on the Hifi forum. Given Hifi’s governance system is a democracy, the quality of the decision-making depends entirely on the quality of the thought process backing the votes of MFT token-holders.

Select one of the available voting options, and click on “Vote”. Next, confirm the message signature within your wallet.
