Probably Nothing

“You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink” is a proverb that means you can give someone an opportunity but not force them to take it. So while we can’t force the $[300 Billion dollar](https://equinebusinessassociation.com/equine-industry-statistics/) performance horse industry onto the blockchain, let’s at least extend the opportunity. From derby winners to barrel racers, we’re setting out to disrupt the high-end of horse racing.

### Howdy Partner

For most of our community, this might be our first rodeo. So we partnered with long-time leaders in the horse-racing industry to be our guide and show us the ropes. We couldn’t be more excited to unveil our newest addition to Hifi’s growing ecosystem of partnerships. We’re partnering with [Crown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/) to take on the 300 Billion dollar performance horse industry. This is our first partnership aimed at onboarding value directly into Hifi’s Lending Protocol.

In our previous blog post, we identified the efforts behind tokenizing Real World Assets (RWAs) as the largest onboarding of value blockchain will ever experience.
> The most ambitious teams both across DeFi and the NFT space are working to bring real-world assets on-chain. We see real estate projects, high-end physical art, and other luxury goods, all being tokenized as NFTs. This effort will result in the largest onboarding of value onto blockchain ever.
> The main challenge and exploration happening right now is to find the right legal structure and infrastructure to bring these ownership rights on-chain in an effective manner. We know this because we’re not sitting idly by waiting for others to figure it out.

Our partnership with [Crown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/) is an effort to directly take part in the massive opportunity that Real World Assets represent to blockchain as a whole. Our positioning is deliberate and informed by our years working in Web3. Crown Ribbon starts with a distinct customer, problem, and solution in mind. We’ve chosen to go after this industry, not because we like to horse around, but because blockchain and specifically Hifi directly solves problems that plague the performance horse industry.

### Hold Your Horses

You’d expect it would be easy to simply buy and hold your horses, but it’s not. The process is cumbersome, dated, and ready for a better alternative. As it turns out, the industry is primed for disruption.

For many racers, their horse is their most valuable possession, more valuable than their home and vehicles. Tapping into that value through traditional means isn’t an option. Even for the best racing operations, traditional financial institutions lack the experience and expertise to underwrite these non-standard assets. Because of our partnership with industry leaders at [Crown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/), Hifi gains access to the necessary experience and expertise to effectively underwrite these Real World Assets.

Holding your horses on-chain unlocks incredible potential for the 300 Billion Dollar performance horse industry. Owners gain access to Hifi’s ecosystem of products for liquidity, tools to fine-tune financial exposure, access to a worldwide audience, and broader DeFi composability!

[Crown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/) is no one-trick pony, they will manage the actual onboarding and issuance of assets on-chain. With the proper legal protections, disclosures, and consideration, Crown Ribbon will serve the interests of owners on and off-chain. Additionally, they have responsibilities to audit custodians, provide off-chain liquidation services when needed, and communicate new offerings.

### Saddle Up

Our deep partnership with [Crown Ribbon](https://www.crownribbon.com/) fits perfectly into our ambitious growth strategy to trail-blaze into the realm of Real World Assets (RWAs), disrupt industries, and help NFT Communities maximize their **growth and retention**. It adds to the efforts happening across the rest of our ecosystem driving value to Hifi’s Lending Protocol. There’s so much more to share about this exciting partnership and industry, so saddle up for an epic adventure full of experimentation, disruption, and growth.
