New Frontiers: Hifi Spins out Sablier as Ecosystem Partner ðŸŽ‰

### The ecosystem is growing!

Since its acquisition in 2020, Sablier has seen incredible traction. Originally thought to be a [solution for payroll](https://medium.com/sablier/introducing-sablier-continuous-payments-on-ethereum-c2bf04446d31), Sablierâ€™s growth came from enabling projects to vest tokens for founders, early employees, and investors in a trustless way.

With over 25K new users, $1B in TVL for the first time and 12K new streams created in 2021, Sablierâ€™s growth has been impressive to say the least.

### Spinoff

Today, we announce with much excitement that Sablier is going to be an independent product with a dedicated team. This wonâ€™t happen all at once, but in the coming months you will begin to see this transition happening.

Having a dedicated team will enable Sablier to serve its growing userbase and innovate with greater speed and agility.

### Hifi Ecosystem Integration

The next major update to Sablier will represent token streams as ERC-721 NFTs, making Sablier streams a compatible collateral on Hifiâ€™s NFT lending platform.

In the coming weeks, we will launch the Hifi Ecosystem and share exciting details on how Sablier and others will integrate into our growing ecosystem of projects and partnerships.
