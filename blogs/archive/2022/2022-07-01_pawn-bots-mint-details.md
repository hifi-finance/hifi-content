Pawn Bots Mint Details

### With the mint phase happening soon, it’s time to go over the details of our new Pawn Bots NFT collection.

There will only ever be 8,888 Pawn Bots in circulation. The mint will be free for anyone holding [MFT](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/hifi-finance) (even just 1 MFT). You can mint at most 2 NFTs per wallet. The art reveal will take place 1–2 weeks after mint.

Most NFT projects have a roadmap, which gives the community a timeline of what to expect in the future when they invest. NFTs are a great way to crowdfund the development of a project while giving the community of holders behind it a unique role in being able to voice their ideas. Sales and royalties generate funds and help the developers achieve said goals.

However, most projects don’t let the community itself dictate when steps within the roadmap are taken. It is usually up to the project’s team and not the community to decide when the roadmap is deployed, or which steps are taken.

Pawn Bots NFT takes a “floor unlocks utility” approach to the progression of its roadmap and places the power into the hands of its community & market. Each step in the Pawn Bots roadmap is unlocked as the floor price increases. This makes the project inherently more decentralized and gives holders more control over the development of the project they’ve chosen to follow.

Pawn Bots have utility in that they will allow their holders to borrow against them. By collateralizing, holders are given the chance to leverage their digital assets strategically. Holders of the Pawn Bots NFT will be able to use their NFT to move in and out of positions, and a portion of the royalties from marketplace sales will be used to burn the Pawn Bots floor.

Pawn Bots minting will go live on July 7, 2022. To mint, visit pawnbots.com and make sure you have MFT in your wallet. For info on how to obtain MFT, see [How to Get Mainframe Token](https://blog.hifi.finance/how-to-get-mainframe-token-93f026a606c3) on the Hifi blog.
