HIFI Token Swap Tutorial

### Learn how to token swap easily with our step-by-step guide

We are proud to introduce the [HIFI Delegation & Token Swap App](https://swap.hifi.finance/#/), a quick and easy process for securely swapping your MFT for HIFI. After completing your token swap, you’ll officially be part of the Hifi DAO and be able to participate in voting for future Hifi Improvement Proposals! Let’s get started.

### Step 1: Prepare and Connect

To prepare for the token swap, it is imperative that you have your MFT on a supported self-custody wallet. You’ll also want a small amount of ETH in your wallet to sign transactions. Currently, the wallets the app supports are [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/), and [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). To begin, visit [swap.hifi.finance](https://swap.hifi.finance/#/) and connect your wallet by clicking the “Connect wallet” button pictured below.

A popover will appear showing a list of supported wallets. Click the supported wallet that contains the MFT you wish to swap for HIFI. You should see your wallet address in the top right corner if you’ve connected properly.

### Step 2: Swap and Review

You are now ready to begin your swap! Click the “Get started” button to initiate the token swap process. Here you’ll see the current balance of MFT in your wallet and how much HIFI you will receive.

Now click “Start your swap process” and it will navigate you to a verification screen to review your swap. Double check everything looks correct using the ratio of 100 MFT to 1 HIFI before clicking “Swap”.

### Step 3: Choose a Delegate

If this is your first time doing the HIFI token swap, you will now be prompted to select a delegate. If you already have a delegate assigned, it will automatically take you to step 4.
> A delegate is a fellow community member that you select to represent yourself. When assigning a delegate, you’re essentially giving them the power to vote on future HIFI Improvement Proposals on your behalf. Your delegate votes are not restricted to Guardians. You’re able to assign your votes to anyone you choose, including yourself.

### Step 4: Accept Transactions

You may have up to 3 transactions to approve from your wallet: 
● Delegation Assignment Transaction 
● Token Spend Transaction for MFT Access
● Swap Approval Transaction

Please note: If you have already assigned a delegate or granted access to your MFT, you will not receive either of these transactions since you’ve already signed them.

### Step 5: Congratulations

You did it! You are now officially part of the Hifi DAO. As a token holder, you can now participate in the governance of the Hifi Protocol by voting on Hifi Improvement Proposals. You are now part of a growing community of HIFI Token holders who are helping to drive the Hifi Protocol towards a more decentralized future. We thank you for your support and look forward to seeing you on the journey ahead!
