An Introduction to Community Governance

### With the upcoming governance modules launching soon, it’s time to learn more about how to create powerful proposals, debate with others and move the Hifi DAO forward.

The mission of making Hifi successful is not just a priority for our own internal team anymore, it’s also the community’s mission. As token-holders, it is your duty and responsibility to participate in Hifi’s governance and make your voice heard.

Working together, we will carry Hifi forward for decades to come.

### Before Creating the Governance Proposal

A governance proposal should always start with discussions, debates and an in-depth analysis. Each argument for or against the proposal should be backed with constructive and factual information. If you are against a proposal, make sure to propose alternatives to lead the way in the direction you think is the right one.

Disagreements within the community will inevitably happen, so it’s important to focus on being constructive and always interpret the other person’s argument in [the most charitable way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).
> **An important reminder:** We aren’t playing against each other, we are in this together — we all want Hifi to succeed. We all share this common interest, so the governance discussions should always get along in a constructive and thoughtful manner.

Proposals including code should be thoroughly audited by the Hifi community. A significant change to the protocol should be audited by a third party, an audit which could be funded by the Hifi DAO.

### Creating the Governance Proposal

After first posting a submission for a proposal on the Hifi Forum and extensively discussing it with other community members, debating, and improving the proposal if needed, it’s time to create the actual proposal if you feel like it has a sufficient approval rate from the community.

Token-holders who hold MFT can vote on the proposal, where 1 MFT equals 1 vote. The more MFT you have, the more votes you have. While this may seem plutocratic, it is in fact quite sensible: the more MFT you own, the more skin in the game you have and the greater the incentives you have to make the project successful. Because of that, you should logically also have more voting power.

### Conclusion

We believe that the arrival of governance will contribute to Hifi’s long-term growth by giving ownership of the project to those who have skin in the game and care about the long-term survival of the project.

The next step for the community is now to get involved in this governance process, get acquainted with how proposals are written and debated, and soon enough start to take the lead of the project and direct the Hifi DAO in the right direction.
