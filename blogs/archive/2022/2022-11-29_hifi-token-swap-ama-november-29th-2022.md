Hifi Token Swap AMA (November 29th, 2022)

### During this Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, Doug took questions directly from the community regarding the HIFI Token Swap, Ethereum Mainnet Proposal, HIFI DAO, HIFI Labs, and much more.

[**Will my tokens on exchange sites ](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=890)[automatically change](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=890)[?](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=890)**

Each exchange will need to make a decision on supporting the token or not. For exchanges that do decide to support the token swap, I do anticipate that they will automatically exchange them on behalf of their customer base, and we’ll work with them to make sure they have access to the tools or help them as needed. I have seen them support similar types of changes in the past, so I don’t anticipate there would be any reason why they wouldn’t support this.

There’s always the option to pull your tokens off exchanges onto a self-custody wallet like MetaMask or Ledger to perform the swap yourself. You’ll always have the ability to transfer them over to the HIFI token using the deployed smart contracts on our front end.

[**How will the protocol earn a profit, and where does that profit go?](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=1005)**

With this transition to the HIFI DAO, the HIFI DAO is in control of everything. All material matters are managed by the HIFI DAO, and the opportunity for profit is embedded inside the protocol. Inside the protocol is a fee switch, very much like Uniswap, where governance can vote to turn on the fee switch and it can then charge a 5 basis point fee, basically an origination fee on all serviced debt by the protocol. The idea is when they turn on the switch, they would need to choose a destination for the fees to go. At that point, it’s up to the protocol. The community can then choose what they do with that.

[**When is the vote taking place?](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=1170)**

December 5th is when the voting will go live. You need to have your tokens off of exchanges before December 5th.

[**How does voting work?](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=1264)**

The way voting works is if you have your MFT in a self-custody wallet like MetaMask or Ledger, you’ll go to [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/#/), search for Hifi, and then you’ll be able to cast a vote when it goes live on December 5th. It’s a pretty simple solution. You’re just signing a contract that doesn’t cost you any gas. You will want a little bit of Ethereum in your wallet so that you can send your tokens back to an exchange if that’s where you like to keep them. 1 MFT = 1 vote, so you can vote with as much or as little MFT as you want.

With the HIFI token, we’re deploying our own governance smart contracts, so it will work a bit differently, but we will have resources available to you to explain exactly how to participate in the first HIFI voting when we get there.

[**How confident are you this DAO can succeed and why?](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=2405)**

From our most active participants in the community, I see a lot of opportunity and people that I ultimately trust and have come to know over time. In particular, our Guardians will be a big help in helping us navigate this new way of working. There are trade-offs in terms of additional costs of operating as a DAO, but this decision enables us to operate in this regulatory climate, and we can’t move forward unless we are decentralized. There are opportunities that we miss unless we decentralize, so it really is the only option.

I choose to make this thing work. With additional resources on the team, we can invest in community management and tools to increase our ability to execute on shorter time frames.

[**Where do Pawn Bots & Sablier fit & what lies ahead for them both?](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=2525)**

Sablier is a separate distinct entity that has its own roadmap, and we have to coordinate with them. The nice thing is we like each other. We’ve worked well in the past. I am hopeful we can do some really innovative and cool stuff there, but they have a distinct roadmap they are working towards that they’ll share and publish.

In terms of Pawn Bots. Pawn Bots is our very own NFT project that we created to be the guinea pig for things like our upcoming liquidity infrastructure layer and liquid NFTs. That way if anything were to go devastating wrong, we are in control of it. We can just reissue the contract and make everybody right by it. This essentially is why Pawn Bots exists, so I expect you’ll continue to see support from us and the Hifi Ecosystem.

[**Can you expand on Real World Assets (RWA) with fixed-rate loans and tokenization? What drew Hifi to explore these?](https://youtu.be/zN31w1Wuftk?t=3350)**

There are certain parts of my job that are very easy. Pursuing the biggest opportunities in the space and identifying them, I think is one of the easier roles I have.

So why fixed-rate lending? Fixed-rate lending is where the world parks the vast majority of its debt behind. It is the preferred instrument for debt because it creates predictability for investors and customers alike.

Why real-world assets? When I look at the potential for blockchain, it’s so much bigger than crypto. My thesis from the beginning is I believe it is going to impact our world as much as the internet. I want to change the world, and I think we are building the tools to be able to do that. I think we are positioning ourselves for when people come around to what we see in traditional financial markets. They are going to want to borrow against the things they already own. Each industry, like real estate, comes with additional considerations and regulations. To take that on, we need to be able to pay for a lawyer and be able to make sure we’re compliant.

I’m not going to comment on where Hifi is going. I’m saving that for our “Probably Nothing” announcement that is happening this week, so look forward to that. You’re going to be surprised. [We’ve tweeted out a bit of a riddle](https://twitter.com/HifiFinance/status/1593701332896010240), and this community has NO idea what’s coming.
