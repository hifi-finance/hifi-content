Strategy: the road ahead

### Our vision for the future.

As we start to build the next chapter of Hifi’s history, it’s important to first clarify what our vision exactly is for the future.

This blog post clarifies our thesis, how we plan to compete against existing widely used products and what Hifi’s edge will be. An updated roadmap that aligns with this thesis will follow.

## Our thesis

Our thesis is simple. As decentralized debt markets mature, participants will prefer greater predictability that only fixed-rate lending can offer. This is supported by the fact that the vast majority of the world’s debt is parked behind fixed-rate instruments. Today in DeFi this is *not* the case.

In order to develop a strategy going forward we need to evaluate the broader environment in which Hifi operates.

To begin, we assert the following:

* The market in which Hifi operates is ‘*decentralized debt marketplaces*.’

* Decentralized fixed-rate products *do not* have broad adoption nor do they have product-market fit.

* Our target customer is a Defi user wanting to borrow against their crypto.

* There are large existing competitors that already service our target customer. These existing products *have* product-market fit.

## Competing against products that have product-market fit

When going up against large entrenched competitors your product or service must be *much better* than the alternatives.

Consumers are always going to buy from the trusted brand unless there is a* big difference. *If Hifi is to be successful, there must be a big difference in our offering compared to every decentralized debt marketplace in existence.

Stripping away our ego and looking pragmatically at our current differences it’s likely that our target customer will judge our current offering to be just slightly better than the competition. It is unlikely that this offering is going to be enough for Hifi to carve out a material amount of market share.

Therefore, we must think bigger, bolder, and our offering must be much, much better. We must be willing to redefine the industry if we are to reach our full potential!

## Hifi’s Edge

It is our belief that unlocking liquidity against high conviction asset classes will drive broad adoption of the Hifi lending protocol. We see the most opportunity in NFTs. It onboards more users into crypto than any other aspect of our space.

NFTs are the common denominator behind the explosion of interest from every major brand into the Metaverse, crypto art, and GameFi. The future is bright for service providers in this modern-era digital gold rush.

In 2022 we will push the industry forward in expanding what can be considered collateral and build at the intersection of the Metaverse and Defi. So in addition to borrowing against the ERC-20’s you know and love, we will expand that offering to include NFTs!

Our aim is to become the most trusted destination to get at-scale liquidity against high conviction crypto assets.
