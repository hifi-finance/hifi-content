Release: Hifi v1 private beta on Rinkeby

### We are proud to announce the private beta of v1, a major update to our fixed-rate lending protocol.

This release brings many significant improvements and features, including multi-collateral vaults, our new Automated Market Maker (AMM), a new multi-collateral liquidation bot, and protocol revenue sources.

### New Automated Market Maker

This release features the new deeply integrated Hifi [AMM](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm), built specifically for fixed-rate lending. The new AMM offers a more capital-efficient solution for Hifi’s [zero-coupon bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp).

### Multi-collateral Vaults

Another major improvement is our multi-collateral vaults which enable anyone to borrow one or multiple assets using one or multiple collateral options, something not possible with v0. We expect this to dramatically improve the user experience, as well as increase the liquidity locked in the Hifi lending protocol.

### Multi-collateral Liquidation Bot

Introducing [our new liquidation bot](https://github.com/hifi-finance/hifi-liquidator-js) specifically made for multi-collateral vaults. The liquidation bot enables anyone running it to detect and liquidate bad debt, ensuring that the protocol always stays solvent and stable.

### Protocol Revenue Sources

This new version of our protocol features the optional ability to charge a small fee transactions that utilize the Hifi AMM, as well as an [origination fee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origination_fee). Fees will be switched off to promote early protocol growth, but the community will be able to turn the fees on at any time once governance is live.

We expect this new source of revenue to help build a sustainable and long-term future for Hifi.

## Private beta

This release marks an important milestone in Hifi’s history, as our lending product is now in its first step of transitioning from an MVP to a fully functional product.

The aim of private beta is to **1)** collect feedback from the community, and **2)** test and prove our new multi-collateral vaults.

First, we will let our Praetorians participate in the private beta. Soon after, the doors will be opened to our Centurions and finally to our Decurions. If you are wondering what all these names are, they are the most active members of our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mhtSRz6) community.

The v1 private beta release of our protocol is currently live on the Rinkeby testnet, meaning that participating in the private beta does not require real funds.

## Next up

After successful rounds of testing and iteration during the private beta on testnet, we intend to release v1 as a public preview on Polygon mainnet to the community as a whole. This public preview will require the use of real funds. During this public testing phase, we will take the time to bring several markets to full maturity in order to test the protocol thoroughly.
