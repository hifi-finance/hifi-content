Upcoming AMA & Incentive Update

### AMA with Doug

This Thursday, February 25th, at 10 AM MST, Doug will host an AMA. So bring any burning questions you have about the launch, the protocol, or anything Hifi related. You can tune in on our youtube channel.

### Updates to ongoing incentives

Hifi has been providing ongoing incentives to LPs who provided liquidity in Balancer and Uniswap pools. We want to thank all who have participated in this effort. As we move into the next phase of our product development, we need to realign incentives to areas that will significantly impact Hifi. Effective immediately, the Uniswap & Balancer pool LP incentives will end. We have already processed the final snapshot of participants for this week and will distribute rewards according to our standard process.

We continue to provide incentives for our ongoing Hummingbot liquidity mining campaign. And look forward to introducing new incentives in the future. To learn more about the Hummingbot campaign, see our previous [blog post](https://blog.mainframe.com/new-liquidity-mining-campaign-for-mainframe-mft-going-live-on-june-16-2020-7aa1d316e8f6). Bring any questions you have to [our discord](https://discord.gg/mhtSRz6), where members of the community and team are happy to help.
