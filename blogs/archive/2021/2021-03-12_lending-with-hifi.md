### Step 1

Head over to [hifi.finance](http://hifi.finance) and click on *Lend & Borrow* in the top menu. This will automatically launch the app for you.

### Step 2

Read the disclaimer, it is there to warn you that we are still in beta and to not use money that you cannot afford to lose. Hit *Accept and Continue* when you are ready to lend.

### Step 3

Click into the input field and type in the amount of USDC you would like to lend. If you want to lend it all, hit *Max*. Click *Lend*!

### Step 4

A dialogue will pop-up informing you of the steps you need to complete before you can lend. In Metamask, *confirm* that you are giving the app permission to interact with your USDC. Once your loan is successful, you will arrive on a confirmation screen. *Close* the confirmation to go back to the Lend screen.

### Step 5

Your lending position will appear above the lend dialogue box. Feel free to lend more or manage your position by hitting *Sell Position*.
