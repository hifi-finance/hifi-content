Spatch → Mainframe

### Our new name.

Our new name is [Mainframe](http://mainframe.co).

When Ryan and I started thinking about email and hacking around on some product ideas in 2013, we decided to code name the project *Spatch*. It was like Dispatch but minus a few letters. We didn’t wanna spend too much time thinking about names because we wanted to start building. We figured we’d get to fixing the harsh-sounding — yet cutesy — name at a later stage.

Well, it’s been two years and it’s time!

***Why Mainframe?***

It’s simple. It’s easy to spell. It’s an actual english word. The dot co domain wasn’t too expensive. It’s got gravitas — which is key as we’re primarily a b2b startup. And perhaps most importantly, it has meaning and symbolism.

If you are a computer science nerd (like us), you’ll know exactly what the original [mainframes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer) were. They were large, powerful machines that were popular in the 70's and 80's (started dying in the 90's). They carried out complex operations and acted as the central nervous system for enterprises. They were relied on for their mission-critical applications because of their performance, reliability, efficiency, and security.

Sounds a lot like what we’re building — except we’re building software, not hardware.

Similar to the mainframes of the old, the modern day [Mainframe](http://mainframe.co) is where all the most important information passes through. It’s the connective tissue for the workplace. It’s reliable, secure and essential to productivity. It’s your space for getting things done. It enables action-based communication while maintaining tight integration with legacy email. It’s the first application you open and the last application you close. It’s your main window, your main inbox, your main dashboard — your main frame.

We’ve been working in and around this space for two years now. It’s been littered with false starts, dead ends, and restarts. Fixing email isn’t trivial — whether it be the protocols, the behavior, the client applications or the use-cases. We’ve built a lot. We’ve tested a lot. We’ve failed a lot. We’ve iterated a lot. And we’ve learned a lot.

And we’re now stronger than ever. We’re starting to see some big momentum and validation on our latest concepts & products. We have some new faces on the team. We just moved into a new office. We feel like it’s the perfect time to start a new chapter and come out fresh with a new name. *Hello Mainframe*.
