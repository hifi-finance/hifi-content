# HIP 10 - Administrative Appointment of DAO Manager

## Summary

This proposal seeks to appoint Doug Leonard as the DAO Manager for Hifi DAO, in accordance with Section 3.2 of Hifi DAO's Association Agreement.

## Motivation

As Hifi DAO is a US entity subject to US tax law, it is necessary to appoint a DAO Manager before filing our first tax return. This appointment is crucial for maintaining compliance and ensuring the DAO can perform actions that cannot be executed on the blockchain.

## Specification

Appoint Doug Leonard as DAO Manager with the following responsibilities and authority:

1. Legal representation of the DAO

2. Financial activities, including tax filings

3. Execution of contractual agreements on behalf of the DAO

4. Performance of administrative duties as required

The full scope of the DAO Manager's authority and responsibilities can be found in [Section 3.2](https://github.com/hifi-finance/legal-docs/blob/main/Formation%20Docs/HIFI%20DAO%20TUNAA.pdf) of Hifi DAO's Association Agreement.

## Impact

This appointment will:

1. Enable Hifi DAO to comply with US tax regulations

2. Provide a formal mechanism for off-chain actions and representation

3. Maintain operational continuity in the DAO's current practices

It's important to note that this appointment does not change how the DAO has been operating and will continue to operate. It simply provides a formal structure for compliance and off-chain activities.

## Action Items

Upon successful voting on this proposal:

1. Doug Leonard will be officially appointed as DAO Manager

2. The appointment will be recorded in the DAO's official records

3. Doug Leonard will be authorized to represent the DAO in legal and financial matters as specified in the Association Agreement

Both proposals are expected to go live Tuesday, September 24, 2024 with _voting expected to begin on **Thursday**, September 26, 2024._
