# HIP 3 - Volkswagen Microbus Collateral Onboarding

# Summary

This improvement proposal aims to form a strategic partnership with Finance Ventures, allowing the [“VWMBp” token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x858f0bdb905fdbb3e04d0430d9b4f9f48381f103) to be integrated into the Hifi Protocol as collateral. The intent is to facilitate Finance Ventures' ability to extend credit to its borrower, Kevin Bradburn, using Hifi Protocol’s DeFi infrastructure, with a collateral ceiling of 10 VWMBp token, a fixed oracle value of $65,000 USD per VWMBp Token, and a 125% collateralization ratio (80% loan-to-value).

The [VWMBp Token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x858f0bdb905fdbb3e04d0430d9b4f9f48381f103) is a digital representation of an extremely valuable vintage [Volkswagen Microbus](https://blog.hifi.finance/introducing-our-first-real-world-asset-2395668f5aaf). Finance Ventures will be originating a loan to the owner using the vehicle as collateral. Capital for the loan will be sourced from the Hifi Lending Protocol. The VWMBp token cannot be liquidated on-chain, but if the borrower defaults there are provisions in the contract for liquidation of the real-world asset.

# Details

Under the proposed Agreement of Association, Hifi DAO will enable Finance Ventures to leverage the Hifi lending protocol by utilizing the VWMBp Token as collateral to secure credit represented by hTokens.

As per the agreement's conditions, there will be a collateral ceiling of 10 VWMBp tokens, which will have a fixed oracle value of $65,000 USD per VWMBp Token, and a 125% collateralization ratio. The collateral ceiling is set as a cap on the credit extended to Finance Ventures in this agreement.

Upon this proposal’s success, Hifi DAO will execute the necessary variable changes to the Hifi Protocol’s Fintroller. Hifi DAO will also enter into a legally binding Agreement of Association with Finance Ventures which can be [viewed here](https://github.com/hifi-finance/legal-docs/blob/main/HIP3/HIFIDAO%20FVLLC%20Contract.pdf).

To safeguard Hifi DAO's interests, Hifi DAO will designate Mainframe Group Inc. to monitor Finance Ventures' monthly financial updates. Finance Ventures is required to comply with specific loan eligibility criteria to ensure only high-quality loans are financed, and they must also provide regular monthly reports.

In case of a default by Finance Ventures' borrower, an explicit collateral liquidation process is in place to ensure the recovery of the outstanding hTokens. More information about Hifi's framework can be found on the blog, [here](https://blog.hifi.finance/real-world-assets-the-framework-f8180a749256).
